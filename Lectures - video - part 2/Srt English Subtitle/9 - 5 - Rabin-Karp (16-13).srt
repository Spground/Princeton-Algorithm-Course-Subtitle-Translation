1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,846
.
And that's still not the end of the story.

2
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:11,131
We're gonna look at one more really
interesting al-, algorithm that has, lots

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,420
of important applications, called a Rabin
Karp Algorithm.

4
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:18,590
Invented by two Turing award winners.
Michael Rabin and Dick Karp.

5
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:24,028
I can remember hearing about this
algorithm, from my friend, Dick Lipton,

6
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,127
who explained it to me over the phone,
and, I, he explained it to me in about,

7
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:33,751
fifteen seconds, and I realized I had to
have this, in the book.

8
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:38,850
And, so now, here we are, presenting it.
Th, that was, in the 70's.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,755
So the basic idea for the Rabin-Karp
algorithm is, has to do with hashing.

10
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:47,853
In it's a particular kind of hashing,
called modular hashing.

11
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:51,516
It's just a particular way of computing a
hash function.

12
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:56,235
It's easiest to think about in terms of
numbers, although it, it works in all

13
00:00:56,235 --> 00:01:00,271
kinds of situations.
Because remember everything in a computer

14
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:05,363
is encoded as a byte, which can be treated
as bytes which could be treated as binary

15
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:09,253
numbers.
And so what we are going to do is in this

16
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:13,400
case We saw a pattern characters are
decimal digits.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,980
And so, we'll treat a sequence of pattern
characters as the decimal number.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,872
And modular hashing is, just take a big
prime.

19
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:30,692
And compute the remainder when you divide
your number by that prime.

20
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:38,715
So in this case, 613 is the remainder that
you get when you divide 26,535 by 997.

21
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:45,033
So you can check that.
So that's what we're going to use as the

22
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:47,340
hash function.
And that.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,251
This type of hashing is widely used.
You have a prime number, we talked about

24
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:58,308
it when we talked about hashing.
It satisfies, it seems to satisfy

25
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:03,831
something like the uniform hash assumption
under various circumstances.

26
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:10,132
So that's our pattern, a five character
pattern, and we're going to keep the small

27
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:16,821
hash values 613 and this is going to
generalize to longer patterns, and we'll

28
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:22,540
talk about that in a minute.
So now, suppose we have this text.

29
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:27,383
And our pattern happens to occur here in
the text.

30
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:34,768
And what the method is built on is the
idea of you take the first five characters

31
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:41,200
in the text and compute its hash value.
In this case, 31,415, mod down 97, is 508.

32
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:44,364
So that's different so that's not the
pattern.

33
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:49,537
Maybe take the next five characters,
that's 201. That's diffent It's not the

34
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,120
pattern.
Take the next one.

35
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:58,098
That's 715, different it's not the pattern
15,926 by 97 is 971, it's not the pattern.

36
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:03,587
Eventually, when you have the text
characters that are the same as the

37
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:08,920
pattern characters you're gonna get the
same result, it's a match.

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,114
If the pattern hat, hash equals the text
sub-string hash you, you have the

39
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:19,787
potential for a match.
And that's what the algorithm is based on.

40
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:25,892
Now it seems like, we're doing a lot of
calculation, with, making numbers out of

41
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:29,893
these things.
And, and keep doing modular arithmetic on

42
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,612
it.
But actually there's, a really, simple way

43
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,910
to, severely limit the amount of
calculation.

44
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,490
And give a quick linear algorithm for,
search.

45
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,582
Sub-string search.
So first thing is how to compute the hash

46
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:51,030
function.
So we take the, just convert the Math.

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,639
So R's our Radix.
So in this example, we're using ten so we

48
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,537
have decimal numbers.
And then the digits, say t's of i That's

49
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:08,629
the text characters.
So we have a number x of I, which is the,

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:18,366
M characters starting at position I.
And that's just in Math, ti<i>R to the M-1</i>

51
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:31,850
So you know, in this case that's
two<i>10000+6<i>1000+5<i>100+3<i>10+5 that's just</i></i></i></i>

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,748
Math for that.
And our goal is so it's an N digit base

53
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:42,764
based our integer modular Q And our and
our goal is to do the math.

54
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:50,412
That gives us the remainder that we would
get when dividing that by Q well there's

55
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,985
really easy method called Horner's Method
that we can use to evaluate a degree in

56
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:02,992
polynomials just with a multiplied M
multiply and add. And we can do the

57
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:10,308
modular computation all the way through at
each step, to keep the numbers less than q

58
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:16,581
and we still get the same result.
And so the idea is, you multiply by R.

59
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:24,650
You go from left to right through the
digits and you just multiply by R and add

60
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,886
the digit, and then do mod q at every
time.

61
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:37,661
So we start with two mod 97 is two.
To six mod 987 is two<i>10+6 mod 987 and</i>

62
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:41,839
that's 26.
And then I take that value.

63
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:47,707
Multiply by ten and add five that's 265
mod 997.

64
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:54,750
In that case it's, it's 265.
So 265<i>10+3 is 2653.</i>

65
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,933
Our remainder is divided by 997, it's 659,
so even though our number gets bigger than

66
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:08,031
997, might take them out every time, we
keep our running total less than 997.

67
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:16,051
And then the last step is to take the 659.
Basically we've thrown out a bunch of

68
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:26,389
multiples of 997 that we don't care about.
And 659<i>10+5 mod 997 is exactly equal to</i>

69
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,350
26535 mod 997 and that's 613.
That's our value.

70
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:39,412
So that's A using Horner's method we got
a, well known linear time method to do

71
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:43,550
compute or hash function with this simple
code.

72
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:50,206
And this notice will work even for a huge
key that we wouldn't compute a hundred

73
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:55,574
dig, convert a hundred digit key in to
some number to do the calculation.

74
00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:02,517
We do one digit at a time using Horner's
method and then we have no limit because

75
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:07,170
we're always keeping our numbers less than
our prime queue.

76
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,130
So that's a first step, so no matter how
big the pattern is,

77
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:17,630
We can efficiently compute a hash or,
since that is the first step.

78
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:28,827
So now the second step for the Rabin Karp
algorithm is to realize that if we know xi

79
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:38,502
mod q we can efficiently compute xi+1 mod
q cause they have a lot of digits in

80
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:44,372
common.
And you can just do a little Math to get

81
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:53,310
to xi+1 you take. Xi, we don't care about
the first digit anymore, so you subtract

82
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,380
it off.
Multiply by r and then add the new digit.

83
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,610
That's like one step of Horner's method.
Now, then you have to take that

84
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,261
computation and you can do mod q all the
way through.

85
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:16,158
All you have to do is pre-compute r to the
n+1 mod q And so here's the computation

86
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:22,476
for one example.
If we're at this position 41592 and we

87
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:32,479
know 41592 mod q we can compute 15926 mod
q by subtracting off 40,000.

88
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:41,596
The TiR-1 and that gives us just the four
digits, multiply by the radix add the new

89
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:51,351
trailing digit and that's the new value.
And if we just keep that all mod q then we

90
00:08:51,351 --> 00:09:02,683
can with just a multiply and an add at
each step we can keep a running total of

91
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:07,874
the Modular hash value of the five digit
thing.

92
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:17,266
So, for example, this is the case that,
that we just did 4152 on 997 is, is done

93
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:25,021
by ex, exactly as we said we subtract and
then add and then multiply by the radix

94
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,415
mod 997.
So, doing those calculations all the way

95
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:33,810
through the search, we eventually get to a
match.

96
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:38,725
That's again remarkably small amount of
code.

97
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:45,873
We're going to keep a long random prime.
Just keep it a little smaller than the

98
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:54,331
biggest long value to avoid overflow.
So we pre-compute r to the m - one mod q

99
00:09:54,331 --> 00:10:00,249
'cause that's the little calculation that
we have to do.

100
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:05,521
We compute the hash function.
And for the pattern.

101
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:13,914
And then, with those pre-computations, the
search is extremely straight forward.

102
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:22,521
So we take our current hash value.
And this is just, add a q make sure it's

103
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,881
positive.
And subtract off rm times the first

104
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:31,750
character in then add in the next
character mod q.

105
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:37,229
And that gives us the text hash for the
current position.

106
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:42,968
And then we compare to see if that's equal
to the pattern hash.

107
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:50,359
Now there's this is an introduction to the
idea of randomized algorithms.

108
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,490
There's two ways to proceed from here.
One way called Monte Carlo version.

109
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:57,955
Where we guaratee that the algorithm is
gonna be quick but with low probability,

110
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:06,694
it might get the answer wrong. In that
version we don't ever bother to check

111
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:06,694
whether the go through and check all
digits to see if there's actually a match.

112
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:25,723
We take queue large enough so that we're
confident the probability of the, to, two

113
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:30,736
digit numbers or two m digit numbers
having the same hash value.

114
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:36,320
And so low that we're not gonna worry
about it, that's called the Monte Carlo

115
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,113
version.
The Las Vegas version is guarateed to get

116
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:44,551
the right answer.
In that one we would go and check to make

117
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:48,774
sure that the M characters match if we
have a hash match.

118
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:55,646
And then if it could be that with such at
a low probability could be that there's a

119
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:59,440
hash match but not a substring match.
Then we're just.

120
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,766
Move on.
And from a theoretical point of view

121
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:11,650
there's some very extremely low
possibility that one could be slow.

122
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,494
But lets look over at what the analysis
says.

123
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:22,499
So the theory says that if you take a
sufficiently large random prime say mn^

124
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:28,650
three So a long value maybe you can get
that and remember n is huge.

125
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:36,594
Then the probability of a false collision
is about 1/n. so you know in a billion

126
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:43,258
things you might get, you might get 1/n,
you might get a false collision.

127
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:49,400
So in practice we choose actually q just
to be, there's no reason not to choose as

128
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,796
large as we possibly can, not related to m
and n.m And then the probably collision is

129
00:12:54,796 --> 00:13:00,653
going to be about 1/q. So we're going to
take it to be like the biggest law, and

130
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:04,404
that means that probably collision is
extremely small.

131
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:10,326
And then you can take your chances.
You can do a Monte Carlo version where you

132
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:13,814
just say I got a match because I got a
hash match.

133
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,710
And be confident in the laws of
probability.

134
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:21,548
And not worry about the client getting the
wrong answer.

135
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:27,634
Or you can have the Las Vegas version
where you go, go ahead and return the

136
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:33,208
correct answer.
And. And be confident that your client's

137
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:40,288
not gonna run into a slow case cuz the
probability is so, so tiny, 1/q, that you

138
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:45,370
don't have to worry about it.
That's the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

139
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,690
Now, why look at this algorithm?
It's linear time.

140
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:51,702
We have other algorithms that are linear
time.

141
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:56,744
One of the key reasons to, be interested
in Rabin-Karp is that it's easy to extend

142
00:13:56,744 --> 00:14:01,724
it to more complicated situations.
So, say you wanna look for one of, several

143
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:05,413
different patterns.
Well, you just compute the hatches for

144
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:10,946
those patterns, and then look for any one
them Use, a symbol table, to look for'em.

145
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:16,172
So, that's a much more, general capability
than, we can provide with the other

146
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,509
methods.
It also can be extended to do

147
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,996
2-dimensional search and other things like
that.

148
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:27,979
For straight suffering search, it's gonna
be a little slower because, there's,

149
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:33,232
interloop it's kind of long, the
arithmatic operation, are gonna be a

150
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:39,725
little slow, if you wanna do the Las Vegas
version you have to back up the text and

151
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:46,219
you have this, Monte Carlo Las, Las Vegas
thing, and you should think about, writing

152
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:52,421
code to extend it to look for any one of p
possible patterns, thats, an interesting,

153
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,170
Algorithmic puzzle as I mentioned is not
so difficult to solve.

154
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,521
So here's our summary.
We started with a brute force algorithm,

155
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:10,667
and although typically you don't have this
worst case thing.

156
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:18,863
It works fairly well for typical cases.
And then we've got the Knuth-Morris-Prath

157
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:24,600
Method that can guarantee linear time and
has no backup.

158
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:29,541
And maybe uses extra space unless you use
Pratt's version.

159
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:37,263
The Aboriamor who can get the running time
down to n/m which is quite an amazing jump

160
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:43,826
and quite useful and in a Rabin Karp
that's very flexible and extends through

161
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:48,845
all these other situations.
This is a nice mac, microcosm of

162
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:56,180
algorithmic technology where, really
interesting, and unique and path breaking

163
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,792
algorithmic ideas give us.
A good algorithm, for even such a simple

164
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:05,527
problem.
That's an introduction to pattern
