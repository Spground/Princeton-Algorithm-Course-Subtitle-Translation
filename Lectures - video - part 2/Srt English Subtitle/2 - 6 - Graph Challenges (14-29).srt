1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,494
Okay.
Now that we, that we've discussed

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:11,077
breadth-first search and depth-first
search in connected components three.

3
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:15,846
Very useful graph processing algorithm for
all sorts of real applications.

4
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:21,234
Now we're gonna go back to the idea of the
different problems that might arise when

5
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:25,259
doing graph processing,
And what are, what are our intuition I-,

6
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,285
with this experience?
And what types of problems are difficult,

7
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:34,239
and what types of problems are easy?
It's not that I have any real answers to

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,460
that but we wanna keep coming back to this
issue,

9
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:41,780
So that we can appreciate a great
algorithm when we see it.

10
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:47,581
So, here's a challenger or an example of a
challenge.

11
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:53,835
So, here's a problem that comes up in
plenty of applications.

12
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:58,640
So you want to know if a given graph is
bipartite.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,195
So what bipartite means is you can divide
the edges into two subsets, divide the

14
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:13,472
vertices into two subsets with the
property that every edge connects a vertex

15
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:20,186
in one subset to a vertex in another.
So in this case, we can assign zero,

16
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:25,658
three, and four to be red vertices.
And if we do that, then every edge

17
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:30,745
connects a red to a white vertex.
That's a bipartite graph and we saw an

18
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,333
example of bipartite graph the Kevin Bacon
graph.

19
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:39,531
We had movies and performers, two
different types of vertices, and every

20
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:45,096
edge went from a movie to a performer.
And in general and other applications, so

21
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:50,733
we want to know is a graph bipartite.
So by graph processing challenge, I mean

22
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:55,824
is how difficult is this problem?
And so what do you think, based on our

23
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,020
experience?
Is this a problem that any programmer

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,804
could do?
Or maybe you need to be a typical diligent

25
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:07,691
student in this course,
Or maybe it's difficult enough that you

26
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:12,482
ought to pay somebody to do it.
Or, actually maybe it's even an expert

27
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:17,625
couldn't do it, and we'll talk about the
precise meaning of that later on.

28
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:23,190
Or maybe we don't even know how difficult
it is, or maybe we can show that it's

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,192
impossible to solve this problem.
These are pretty broad categories, and

30
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:33,265
you'd like to think that we could
categorize problems in these kinds of

31
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:37,077
categories.
So what about biparting? We'll do this for

32
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:40,044
a bunch of problems, but what about
bipartitenes?.

33
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:45,740
Well the answer for that one is that you
can use DFS to get this done.

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,140
I wouldn't think that any programmmer can
do it.

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,853
Ask a friend.
But with DFS, you can see in the book, a

36
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:58,258
pretty simple DFS based solution, that to
this problem.

37
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,671
That'll tell you whether a graph is
bipartite, by labeling vertices in such a

38
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:08,149
way.
If it is bipartite, that, all the edges

39
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:12,940
have the property to go from one set, one
vertex to another.

40
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:20,614
So definitely a good exercise after this
lecture is to try to write a program that

41
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:25,978
test whether a graph is bipartites or not.
Okay, let's, oh, here's another

42
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:31,326
application of this by the way.
That dating graph for the sexual

43
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:38,303
transmitted diseases so there's males and
females, is that one gonna be bipartite?

44
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:43,420
I think maybe this one is but, nowadays
maybe not in general.

45
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:52,271
Okay, what about this one, Does a graph
contain a cycle or not?

46
00:03:54,009 --> 00:04:01,816
So in this case, there's a cycle, zero to
five to four to six back to zero, and this

47
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:08,642
other cycle's two, zero, one, three, two
there are two, four, six those are all

48
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:12,885
cycles.
So how hard is it to find a cycle in a

49
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:18,683
graph in these categorizations well that
one, It's very simple.

50
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,769
This one, maybe any programmer could do.
Maybe.

51
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:26,206
You have to have the graph representation,
But you have to use DFS.

52
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,322
Well, you could figure out a way to do it
without, probably,

53
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:35,723
But anyway it's really simple with DFS.
You, you don't even need to hire an expert

54
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:41,012
for finding a cycle.
Alright here's a classic graph processing

55
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:45,725
problem that dates back to the eighteenth
century.

56
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:54,086
So it's this town in Konigsberg in Prussia
at the time where there's an island,

57
00:04:54,352 --> 00:05:02,179
And the river kinda comes in and branches
around the island and then goes out in two

58
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:06,208
branches.
And there's a bunch of bridges, five

59
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:11,723
bridges onto the island, two from the
banks and one across, to the this third

60
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:15,960
peninsula and then there's two bridges
crossing that way,

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,130
So a total of seven bridges one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

62
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:28,413
And Euler who's a famous mathematician
would go out on Sunday stroll in this

63
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:36,073
place and came up with the idea.
You know could anyone find a way to go on

64
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:42,130
a Sunday stroll and cross each one of
these bridges exactly once.

65
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:52,023
So that's, often talked of as, the,
original graph processing problem.

66
00:05:52,372 --> 00:06:01,800
So, in terms of graphs, it's is there a
cycle that uses every edge exactly once.

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,710
Given a graph, is there a cycle that uses
every edge exactly once?

68
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:12,879
A and actually, a Euler, proved, a let's
say first theorem in graph theory, a if

69
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,866
its connected, and all the vertices have
even degree, you can always do it.

70
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:23,830
In this case you can't because there's a
vertex with odd degree.

71
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:29,169
So that's, that's the answer to the
existence, is there a cycle.

72
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:36,273
But suppose you wanted to find the cycle.
So you can go ahead and check the degree

73
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:40,936
of every vertex.
We looked at easy code for that to know

74
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:47,681
that there exists a cycle but how about
finding one that uses every edge exactly

75
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:51,261
once.
So in this case, here's the cycle that

76
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:56,757
uses every edge exactly once.
And this graph every vertex has even

77
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:02,406
degree, and if you go zero, one, two,
three, four, two, zero, six, four, five,

78
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:09,759
zero you get to every edge exactly once.
That's an Eulerian Cycle. so how about

79
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,059
that one?
Is that any programer a or do you have to

80
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,496
hire an expert, or is it impossible?
Well this one we have it listed as a

81
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:24,517
typical, diligent algorithm student can do
it.

82
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:30,021
But it's a, it's a, a bit of a challenge.
It's a, an interesting program and again

83
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:35,861
once you get through the bipartite graph
on you can think about this one.

84
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:41,701
A it makes some sense what the algorithm
does, but it might take you a few tries to

85
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:46,601
get the code debugged,
Let's say then you'll find code for it, it

86
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,239
looks like.
Alright.

87
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:56,897
So that's a Eulerian Cycle What about if
you want to visit every vertex exactly

88
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:59,288
once?
So, you don't care about going over all

89
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:02,524
the edges, you just want to get to all the
places.

90
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,760
That's called the, in this case there is a
way.

91
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,745
For this graph zero, five, three, four,
six, two, one, zero.

92
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:15,193
So that's a way to get to every vertex
exactly once.

93
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:20,756
This is sometimes called the traveling
salesperson problem on graphs.

94
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:27,770
If the sales, traveling salesperson has to
get to every city and wants to just go

95
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,850
there once without retracing steps.
So how about that one?

96
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:39,206
The, every edge is more to visit, it might
seem more challenging.

97
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:45,741
And, actually, maybe if you have any
experience with this, you realize that

98
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:50,318
this one is intractable.
That's called the Hamiltonian Cycle

99
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:53,624
problem, and it's a classical NP-Complete
problem.

100
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:58,550
We'll be talking about NP-Complete
problems at the end of the course, but

101
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,082
basically the idea is that nobody knows an
efficient solution to this problem for

102
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:07,403
large graphs.
And it's a frustrating situation that

103
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:11,629
we'll talk about.
But, you definitely not gonna, solve it by

104
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:17,440
just being a diligent algorithm student a
and not even hiring an expert will get it

105
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,610
solved, no matter how much the expert
charges.

106
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:26,436
So the intuition on finding a cycle that
visits every edge once.

107
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:31,347
Yeah, you could do it.
Find a cycle that visits every vertex

108
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:36,341
once, probably not.
That's the kind of challenge that we face

109
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:40,420
when addressing applications of graph
processing.

110
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:46,066
Here's another example.
Problem is, given two graphs you want to

111
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:51,550
know are they identical except for the way
that we need the vertex.

112
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,381
So here's an example of, a these two
graphs don't look all that identical, at

113
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,895
all.
But if you, take zero here and rename it

114
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,650
four and one and rename it three and like
that,

115
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,759
Then sorry zero here and name it four and
one and rename it three and like that.

116
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,354
Then you'll see that they are the same
graph.

117
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:21,169
They represent the same connections.
And in so many applications where, maybe

118
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,258
the vertex names are, are a bit arbitrary
or you just wanna know.

119
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:30,753
Really the interest is in the structure of
the connections, you might wanna know if

120
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:34,714
just the way that I name the vertex makes
the graph different?

121
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:39,890
Or if I have two classes that have two
different kinds of interactions, is it the

122
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,746
same interactions that's independent of
the people or scientific experiment

123
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:49,665
studying a property of the universe or
whatever, you might wanna know, is that

124
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:55,236
connection structure the same or not?
That's called the Graph Isomorphism

125
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:59,310
Problem.
How difficult you think that one is?

126
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:06,306
So, you know, you could, there you can try
all possible ways of renaming the

127
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:11,554
vertices,
But there's really a lot of ways, in

128
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:15,490
factorial ways.
Way too many to try for a huge graph.

129
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:20,796
Is there efficient way to do it,
Or is it intractable like the Hamiltonian

130
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:24,488
Path Problem.
Where it's in this category that nobody

131
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:28,390
knows an efficient algorithm for but there
could be one.

132
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:34,521
Actually for Graph Isomorphism, that's one
that's stumped mathematicians and computer

133
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:39,050
scientists for many years.
Nobody knows even how to classify this

134
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,603
problem.
We don't know if it's easy or if it's in a

135
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:47,829
class of problems that are, we don't know
how to solve but there could be a

136
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:51,103
solution.
We can't show that it's impossible or

137
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:56,360
guaranteed to be difficult.
Nobody knows how to classify this problem.

138
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,735
Again, pointing out that, even for a
relatively simple problem to state.

139
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:07,403
The state of our knowledge and
understanding the properties of algorithms

140
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:11,600
to solve such problems, is, it's
incomplete for sure.

141
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,865
So one last one, here's a graph processing
challenge.

142
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:19,825
So this graph, when it's laid out it's got
two edges that cross between, between

143
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:24,408
three and four and zero and five.
And in general if you have a graph that

144
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:29,494
you've got, so say the social networking
graph of a small class, you want to study

145
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:34,455
that graph and look at it, you want to
draw it on the plane and maybe you don't

146
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,720
want, you want to do it without having
edges crossed.

147
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,255
So in this case there is a way to place
the vertices in the plain so that when you

148
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,711
draw the edges no two of them cross.
So, how difficult is that problem, even is

149
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:56,129
it possible to do or not.
So, that's a classic problem in

150
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:03,453
graph-processing that, came up, from, the
first time that people were ever sending

151
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:08,226
graphs in computers.
And the answer to this one is also,

152
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:14,398
interesting to contemplate.
There's a linear time algorithm known for

153
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:19,180
this based on DFS.
So that means the running times, you could

154
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,844
run it on huge graphs.
You could know, whether or not you could

155
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:28,508
lay it out in the plane.
It was discovered, by Tarjan in the

156
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,307
1970's.
And you heard that name come up again, in

157
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,460
graph processing.
Based on DFS,

158
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:40,446
But, if you really wanna get this done,
you need to hire an expert, 'cause that is

159
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:46,084
quite a complex algorithm,
And probably, beyond, what a diligent

160
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:50,530
algorithm student, or a professor, might
accomplish.

161
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:58,068
So, that's the kind of another point on
this range of difficulty of graph

162
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:02,533
processing problems.
So there's no question that graph

163
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:08,017
processing is challenging.
And this introductory lecture gave us

164
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,699
numerous useful graph processing
algorithms.

165
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:18,436
But still leaves us with the feeling that
there's plenty more to know and we'll

166
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:21,100
cover some more in later lectures.
