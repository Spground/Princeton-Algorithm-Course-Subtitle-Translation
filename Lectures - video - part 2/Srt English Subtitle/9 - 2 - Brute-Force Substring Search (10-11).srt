1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:11,039
As usual, it's very instructive to take a
look at the simplest brute force algorithm

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,412
for the problem.
We'll look at that in a little detail,

3
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:21,567
because it illustrates, really what,
fundamental issues involved with getting

4
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:27,478
efficient algorithms for this.
And it's also the basis for more efficient

5
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:31,609
algorithms.
So the brute force method, we could give

6
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:37,440
in a beginning programming class.
You have your text, you have an index I

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,552
that index as in to text, and you have an
index j that indexes into the pattern.

8
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:50,947
And, start out with both i and j at zero,
and you compare text to pattern, and you

9
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:56,916
keep going until you find a mismatch.
If you find a mismatch before the end of

10
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:01,752
the pattern, then what you do is move the
pattern over one position,

11
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:05,795
That corresponds to simply incremental the
text pointer.

12
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:10,919
And then, here we have a mismatch right
away, so we move the pattern over one

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,045
position, increment the text pointer.
And then starting with I at two, we

14
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:21,604
compare the second text character with j
of zero, the first pattern character.

15
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:25,863
Increment j to one, increment i to three,
we have a mismatch.

16
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:32,646
Mismatch happens at j and +J, j. the jth
character the pattern versus the iJ +

17
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:37,859
character of the text.
Now we have a mismatch, move over.

18
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:45,568
That's increment i to three, compare the
first character of the pattern, j = zero

19
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:50,663
would be the i plus j pattern of the text.
That's a mismatch.

20
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:55,192
Move over one.
So we go first one is a match.

21
00:01:55,192 --> 00:02:00,773
The second one j of i is four compare
against five, that's a mismatch.

22
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:04,332
Move the pattern over one, that's a
mismatch.

23
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:10,613
Finally get to i = position six, and we go
for j equals zero, one, two, three, all

24
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:14,050
matches.
When j gets to four, which is the number

25
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,700
of characters in the pattern that's when
we know we've found a match.

26
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:23,570
So, in this table, the entry's engraved,
just there for a reference.

27
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:29,057
The black ones are where when we found
matches, and the red ones are where we

28
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:33,379
found mismatches.
So, that's, we do the trace before the

29
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,260
code, because the code is extremely
simple.

30
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:42,622
So this is, to implement brute force
substring search, to look for a pattern, a

31
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:49,298
given pattern, in a given text, or for job
as index of, this woud be, on the index of

32
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:55,749
method in, string, takes the argument
pattern. So we get the pattern length, and

33
00:02:55,749 --> 00:03:00,889
we get the text length.
And we're going to potentially look at

34
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:07,915
every, straight, the pattern could start
at any position in the text from zero to N

35
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:12,758
- M.
And for every value of i, we've create a

36
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:19,869
new j and we look for the match between
the pattern in position j and the text

37
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:26,460
character of position + j.
If we get all, all the way to j = m, then

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,183
we found a match in i.
If we get a mismatch, then we get a break

39
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:37,040
before j = m, and we go and try the next
value of i.

40
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,085
And if we get all the way through there
without returning, then we just return N,

41
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:48,978
which is one past the index of the last
text character, the length of the text.

42
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:54,117
And that's an indication that the pattern
was not found in the text.

43
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:59,180
Very straightforward implementation of the
pattern match algorithm.

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,215
Now, the key point is that,
This algorithm is fine in, in many

45
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:10,703
contexts, and actually it's the one that
Java's index of uses.

46
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:14,770
But the real problem is that it can be
slow. Number one,

47
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,252
Just the algorithmic problem,
It can be slow if there's a lot of,

48
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:23,243
repeat, repetitive characters in the text
and the pattern.

49
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:28,776
For example, suppose, that the, text is,
all A's and a B, and imagine that there is

50
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:34,378
a million A's and a B or whatever.
And then the pattern also was a smaller

51
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:40,039
copy of the same thing, all A's and a B.
Then what happens in this case is that for

52
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,421
every possible position matching the
pattern against the text, we go through

53
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:50,190
all the pattern characters and only find
the mismatch on the last one.

54
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,796
So,
And then we find a mismatch, we have to go

55
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:58,725
over one and try them all and find the
mismatch in the last one.

56
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:04,474
And we eventually do find a match, but for
every text character we've looked at

57
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:10,151
almost M - one pattern characters.
So, this is a worst case that shows that

58
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:15,902
the running time of the brute force
algorithm can be proportional to M  N,

59
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:20,925
where M is the pattern length.
And the pattern could be long, say that

60
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:26,531
the pattern could be hundred characters
and N can be huge, like a billion and

61
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,534
that's going to be slow,
Particularly by comparison to the

62
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:36,504
alternatives that we're going to look at.
Now a more important issue than just the

63
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,780
worst case performance is the idea of
backup.

64
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,873
As I mentioned, for lots of applications,
if we're going to put our machine in, on

65
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:52,361
one of the wires of the Internet and watch
the input go by or if we just take the

66
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:57,109
abstract standard input model, you don't
get to go, you don't get to back up when

67
00:05:57,109 --> 00:06:02,727
you find a mismatch but the brute force
algorithm is always backing up.

68
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:07,080
If we go through, matching our pattern
against our text,

69
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,645
When we find a mismatch,
We say we want to move the potential

70
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:16,210
pattern over one position,
But that means backing up in the text.

71
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:23,209
So, we would that's, ways to deal with
that by, saving the most recent M text

72
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:29,422
characters that we've seen.
But it's definitely problematic for larger

73
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:35,949
patterns and certainly inconvenient. so
the brute force algorithm uses backup.

74
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:40,117
And so you could maintain a buffer as I
mentioned,

75
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:46,409
But what we're going to look at is an
ingenious way couple of ingenious ways to

76
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:50,529
avoid having to do backup.
To setup for that,

77
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:56,222
We're going to look at,
A slightly different implementation or

78
00:06:56,222 --> 00:07:00,251
alternate implementation of brute force.
It, it,

79
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:05,507
Compares the same characters as the
previous, implementation.

80
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,282
But, it, does things in a slightly
different order, without, without a second

81
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:17,226
for loop. And it does the explicit backup,
so let's look at that.

82
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:23,030
So, we have our i and j pointers, and, and
we initialize them both at zero.

83
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:29,467
And so it's a for loop where, I gets
incremented on every iteration through the

84
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:36,550
loop.
And so what we do is, as long as we see a

85
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,732
match we also increment J, so that while
the pattern is matching we're implementing

86
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:48,751
both I and J.
When we see a mismatch what we do is just

87
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:53,062
subtract.
The current value of j from i the pointer.

88
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:57,222
That's the next, character that we have to
look at.

89
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:03,737
So, when we find this mismatch, we wanna,
subtract the current value of J.

90
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:07,505
Then increment I at the end of the four
loop.

91
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:14,569
And that puts us right on the, next, text
character that we wanna look at and then

92
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,472
we reset j to zero.
So this, does the same, Character

93
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:23,777
comparisons.
But it explicitly shows that we're backing

94
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:28,231
up in the text.
And then, if we ever get to the end of the

95
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:33,947
pattern then we return I minus M.
Which is the position of the first

96
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:39,663
character in the text that matches the
pattern which we found there was M

97
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:42,336
matches.
So it's an alternate implem,

98
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:49,037
implementation that will come back to.
So, the ideas that there are a couple of

99
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:55,477
out rhythm challenges even though this
brute force method, is simple it is not

100
00:08:55,477 --> 00:09:00,327
always good enough.
And so the first one is just, from a

101
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:04,541
purely algorthmic stand point.
This is a challenge.

102
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,176
Do we need N  M?
Or M is the length of the pattern?

103
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:11,982
Or can we do it in time independent of the
length of the pattern?

104
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:16,550
What we want is a linear time guarantee.
And that was a fundamental problem

105
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,420
algorithmic problem that people worried
about.

106
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,173
And for a, for a, for a bit and we're
going to look at the, how people approach

107
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:30,392
this fundamental algorithmic problem.
And then there's the practical challenge

108
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:36,881
of we don't, we might not have the room or
the time to save the text and actually the

109
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:41,631
judge might not be happy about us saving
text away in some computer.

110
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,910
So we want to avoid backup in the text
stream.

111
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,322
All we're supposed to know about is our
pattern.

112
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:53,340
And we're supposed to light the light if
we find our pattern and that's it.

113
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:00,354
So what we're gonna see next is a way to
deal with both of those challenges at the

114
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,200
same time.
