1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:11,326
Let's finish up by looking at some
applications of maxflow like shortest

2
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:17,352
paths maxflow is a very widely-applicable
problem solving model. And it is really

3
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:22,582
important to recognize at this stage,
We've looked at a lot of algorithms for

4
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:26,308
solving specific problems.
And they're important problems.

5
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:30,557
And it's important to have efficient
algorithms for solving them.

6
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:36,245
But when you have something like maxflow
or shortest paths the, the importance that

7
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:41,605
we attach to them is really magnified by
the idea that they have this property

8
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:47,097
that, that they're a very general way to
state a problem and we have many, many

9
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:52,470
practical situations that we can cast in
terms of these problems.

10
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:57,141
We looked at arbitrage coming or reducing
down to a shortest paths problem.

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:02,418
And we'll look at a bunch of problems that
don't seem to be related at all, that can

12
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:06,742
be modeled as maxflow problems.
So, they're extremely important because

13
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:11,628
they're problem solving models that work
for a broad variety of important

14
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:15,232
applications.
Number one that wouldn't be any good if we

15
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:18,286
didn't have efficient algorithms for
solving them.

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,523
But we do have efficient algorithms for
solving them.

17
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:26,226
And so, that magnifies their importance.
And that's why people work so hard on

18
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:29,830
finding efficient algorithms for solving
these problems.

19
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,640
And we'll talk about that as well in a
minute.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:00:58,905
So, these are, again, just a few of the
many, many algorithms applications of

21
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,117
maxflow We saw an image processing
algorithm called syncarving for shortest

22
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,626
path.
There's another one called segmentation

23
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:55,098
for maxflow. Again, if you have an image
and you have one vertex per pixel you have

24
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:59,855
a huge, huge graph.
And you have many explicit huge graphs and

25
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:06,406
we've talked about those types of things.
But there are other things where the graph

26
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:12,912
is, is an abstraction that it gets
involved in a model of the abstract graph

27
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:18,114
and the maxflow problem.
Its maybe a bit surprising at first, and

28
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:23,240
we'll look at a couple examples of that to
illustrate the point.

29
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:27,200
Over here is a medical example having to
do with it.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,216
That's the, the image processing one on a
medical example to help identify some

31
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:37,624
important part of a medical image.
So, we'll look at a, at a couple examples

32
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:43,807
to that the idea of a general problem
solving model that, once we have an

33
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:49,400
efficient algorithm, then we can think
about using the problem solving model.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,582
And later on, we'll see that this, this
concept of a general problem solving model

35
00:02:55,582 --> 00:03:01,250
has really profound implications and we'll
be looking at that later on.

36
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,654
So, let's just look at a, at a couple of
examples.

37
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:08,130
Here's one called the bipartite matching
problem.

38
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:12,212
So you have this is a bit of an idealized
situation.

39
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:16,072
But it works in more messy, real life
situations, too.

40
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,378
So, there's n jobs out there and n
students apply for them.

41
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:25,722
And we'll use a small example where
there's five students and five jobs.

42
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,360
But, of course, in the real world, this
can be huge.

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,446
Now during hiring season, the students go
out and apply for the jobs and they each

44
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:40,481
get a bunch of offers.
So looking at it from a student's point of

45
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,031
view.
Alice gets offers from Adobe, Amazon, and

46
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:47,433
Google.
Adobe makes offers to Alice, Bob, and

47
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:51,426
Carol, and like that.
So, this is an association between

48
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:55,420
students and jobs.
Everybody gets several offers.

49
00:03:55,847 --> 00:04:03,491
And in question is well, it would be good
if everybody got a job, right?

50
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:08,918
And the question is, is there some way for
everybody to get a job.

51
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:12,749
That's called the bipartite matching
problem.

52
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:19,532
And it comes up in lots of forms directly
related to graph processing.

53
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:25,176
Now, we could study and people do study
algorithms for explicitly solving this

54
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:29,216
particular problem.
But what I want to emphasize is that

55
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:32,547
actually, maxflow is a reasonable model
for it.

56
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:37,437
So, we can use our efficient maxflow
implementation to get it solved.

57
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,470
We don't have to come up with a
specialized algorithm for this problem.

58
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:47,619
So, in terms of graphs, it's called the
bipartite matching problem,

59
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,959
Given a bipartite graph, find a perfect
matching.

60
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,735
And a bipartite graph is one where you
have two sets of vertices, in this case,

61
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:02,048
one to corresponding to students and
another corresponding to companies.

62
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,321
And you have every edge in the graph goes
from one type of vertex to other, the

63
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:13,192
other type of vertex.
And a matching in the graph is a set of

64
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:19,570
edges that are disjoint that disconnects
two vertices but that's it.

65
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:25,360
And so, in this case, there's a perfect
matching works out that if Alice takes the

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,943
Google job and Bob takes the Adobe job and
Carol takes the Facebook job and like

67
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:35,264
that, then everybody gets a job.
So, that's a perfect matching.

68
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,771
But you can also have a situation where
that's not possible.

69
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:45,165
So let's look at how to formulate,
How to, well, the one thing is, how do we

70
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:49,603
find the matching?
And then the other thing is, is there one?

71
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,383
So this is easy to formulate as a matching
network flow problem.

72
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:59,481
That's what this diagram shows.
So, what we'll do is we'll create our

73
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:05,041
source and target vertices.
We'll have one vertex for each student.

74
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,909
One vertex for each company in the flow
network.

75
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,743
And we'll add a capacity one edge from s
to each student.

76
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:20,673
And a capacity one edge from t to from
each company to t and then it doesn't

77
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:25,992
matter what the capacity.
We'll add an infinite capacity edge from

78
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:33,434
each student to each job offer.
And then, we'll ask for a maximum flow in

79
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:38,982
this graph.
So, you can see that the flow, every

80
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:49,560
augmenting path has to go from s to a
student to a company to t and so, the flow

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,201
will give us the match and let's see how
it works.

82
00:06:54,464 --> 00:07:01,556
This is a, a one to one correspondence
between perfect matchings and bipartite

83
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:08,824
graphs, and integer value maxflows. so, in
this case, there's a flow of value five.

84
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:13,290
And that flow gives us the matching
immediately.

85
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:21,274
So what the mean cut tells us if, if
there's a no perfect matching, explain

86
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,065
why.
So, here's an example that maybe could

87
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:34,348
have happened with the job offers.
And when the we're algorithm terminates it

88
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:43,064
terminates with a cut we're the, a cut of
the bipartite graph, which separates two,

89
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:48,647
four, and five from seven and ten.
And essentially the cut tells us that

90
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:54,606
students in two, four, or five can only be
matched to companies seven and ten.

91
00:07:54,606 --> 00:08:00,038
You could see all the edges from two,
four, five go to seven and ten, so you

92
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:06,601
have two companies and three students.
So, there's no way that everybody can be

93
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:14,516
matched, somebody's gonna be left out.
So that's a the students, so that they'll

94
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:19,423
be a mean cut, and the s will be the
students on the s side and t will be the

95
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:24,782
companies on the s side and if it's bigger
than, s is bigger than t, then I can't

96
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:28,592
have a matching.
So in this case at, there's only, four

97
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:34,399
jobs and somebody is going to be left out.
It's also interesting to trace through

98
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,740
what happens with the maxflow algorithm on
bipartite graphs like this.

99
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:46,057
Essentially augmenting paths or usually
forward edges makes some matching.

100
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:51,841
And then if it's possible to find a path
that undoes some matching.

101
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,148
It, zig zags through, undoing matching and
trying other ones to find a way through to

102
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:03,943
the target.
But if there's no perfect matching,

103
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:08,510
there'll be a mean cut.
And that one will explain why.

104
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,213
So, that's a problem,
The bipartite matching problem that we can

105
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:18,630
model as a maxflow algorithm and just use
our existing code to solve it.

106
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,605
Here's another one that's even further
away.

107
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:27,427
It doesn't seem to have a graph at all,
but it does.

108
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:31,233
It's called the baseball elimination
problem.

109
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:39,270
In this is again, just to show the breadth
of applicability of the maxflow model.

110
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:45,397
It's interesting at certain times of year,
you get near the of the baseball season

111
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:52,172
and often you'll hear in the news, or see
in the paper, or see in the web, that your

112
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:57,843
team is mathematically eliminated.
Actually most of the time, they don't

113
00:09:57,843 --> 00:10:04,094
really get that right because they don't
do the computation that we're going to

114
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:08,559
talk about next.
Sometimes, it's easy this is an example

115
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,267
where it's easy.
So we've got four teams, they already have

116
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:18,220
this win-loss record and this is the
number of games to play.

117
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:28,088
So in this case Montreal has only three
games to play. so the best they could do

118
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:32,489
is win 80.
Ag, but Atlanta has already got 83 wins so

119
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:38,935
there's no way Montreal is going to win.
So, that's a mathematical elimination that

120
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:44,201
anyone could figure out.
Usually the newspaper will get that one

121
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:48,682
right.
So but sometimes it's more complicated if

122
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:54,942
you look, say, this case.
So Philly has 80 wins, three games to

123
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:59,103
play.
So the best they can do is 83 wins.

124
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:06,749
So that's interesting.
But the thing is that Atlanta has a bunch

125
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:12,460
of games against, it's got six games
against the Mets.

126
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:19,149
And either Atlanta wins one of them, which
would give Atlanta 84 wins, or the Mets

127
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,030
win all of them, in which case, they get
84 wins.

128
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,407
Either way, Philadelphia is mathematically
eliminated.

129
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:32,444
That's a bit more complicated decision
about which team wins.

130
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:38,060
The thing is and there's many more
complicated situations that show up. And

131
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:43,915
the observation, just from these two easy
examples, is that you can't figure out

132
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:49,206
who's mathematically eliminated without
knowing the full schedule of games.

133
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:54,568
It depends, not only on how many games
were already won, how many are left to

134
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:58,659
play, but it depends on the schedule and
who's playing who.

135
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:04,585
And usually, your average sportswriter is
not going to do that computation without a

136
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:07,830
computer.
And I hope that one of you becomes a

137
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,570
sportswriter and puts this in for the
future for us.

138
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:15,805
So let's look at a more complicated
situation.

139
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:23,238
So this is the American League East awhile
ago near the end of the season.

140
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:29,634
And question is which teams are
mathematically eliminated and which ones

141
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:38,019
aren't.
Now in this case it turn's out that the,

142
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,955
this is pretty far from the end of the
season actually.

143
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:48,843
These 27 games to finish.
And this is a proof here that Detroit is

144
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:54,687
mathematically eliminated.
But it's a pretty complicated argument and

145
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:58,894
well, you can, you can reason it out with
arithmetic.

146
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:04,192
The tough part is to figure out this set
of teams here are.

147
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:10,659
So what we're going to see is that you can
do a maxflow computation to figure out

148
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:15,256
this sets of teams.
And this, let's just look at it for this

149
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:18,676
example.
So, at this point, Detroit is

150
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:26,365
mathematically eliminated.
And so it's got 27 games to play, so it

151
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:35,327
could in theory, win 76 of the games.
Now but the logic that will convince you

152
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:42,764
that they are eliminated is that if you
take the four teams the other four teams

153
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,294
and add up all their wins there's 278 of
them.

154
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,347
And you look at the remaining games
there's 27.

155
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:58,019
So somebody's gotta win every one of those
games.

156
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:07,084
The total number of games won for that set
of The teams is 305, and if you divide by

157
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,346
four.
It means the average is 76.25.

158
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:15,940
And right there is a proof that one of
them is got to win 77 games.

159
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,287
That takes a little thought, but if you
have the four teams, then from the

160
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:28,718
remaining games, you can figure out that
Detroit is mathematically eliminated.

161
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:32,643
But the key is, how do we find those four
teams.

162
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:39,241
And the answer, as I've already said, is
it's maxflow. and so this is a maxflow

163
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:45,955
network that can be used to solve the
baseball elimination problem.

164
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:54,561
So the intuition is that, that you have a
source vertex and you have what happens in

165
00:14:54,561 --> 00:15:00,624
the remaining games flowing from the
source to the target.

166
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,956
So here we're trying to prove that team
four is we're trying to decide if team

167
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:11,058
four is eliminated or not.
That's Detroit, in this case.

168
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:17,031
And so, what we need is a vertex for each
pair of vertices that are not the team

169
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:21,852
we're interested in.
And so, that's going to relate to all the

170
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:25,881
remaining games because these are the
pairs of teams.

171
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:31,644
And then you have an edge from the source
to each one of those vertices.

172
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:37,610
And the capacity of the edge is the number
of games left between those two.

173
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:43,840
So that's on one end.
And then, you have a vertex for each team.

174
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:48,025
And then what we do for each one of these
pair of vertices,

175
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:52,285
We put infinite capacity edges to the two
teams involved.

176
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:58,040
So, the flow is going to be an integer
flow, so some of it will go one way and

177
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,646
some of it will go the, the other way.
But then, for each of the teams what we're

178
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:09,625
going to do is, make sure that they don't
win more games than team four, the team

179
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:14,494
we're interested in.
So, we'll put this upper bound on the flow

180
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:21,324
here that we won't let the numbers of wins
get better than what our team of interest,

181
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:26,160
team four can do.
And the fact is that if you compute a

182
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,949
maxflow of this you can convince yourself,
that if you can fill this network up

183
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:41,229
going, going from s in, in the maxflow
Then team four, team four is not going to

184
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:45,716
be eliminated.
Nobody's going to get more wins than team

185
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:49,331
four.
And so the way to solve the baseball

186
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:55,490
elimination problem is to run maxflow on
this network, and the mean cut will give

187
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,724
the set of keys, it's our, mean cut will
give the set of teams that you needed in

188
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:08,181
this calculation to figure out to prove to
a friend that, or to a sportswriter that

189
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:11,669
the team you're interested in is, is
eliminated.

190
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,532
An interesting application of maxflow.
Again, we just take our problem, use it to

191
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:22,851
build a network solve the problem on the
network using our existing code and

192
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:27,050
translate that solution to a solution to
our original problem.

193
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:31,919
That's called reduction and it's a very
important technique that we're going to

194
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,440
use we're going to talk about it in some
detail later on.

195
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:42,236
So now we come to the theory of maxflow
algorithms.

196
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:48,435
This is ,, an even hotter area than
minimum spanning tree and shortest paths

197
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:53,676
that we've looked at before and that it's
a very frustrating situation for

198
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:58,280
theoretical computer scientists.
And that we have this relatively

199
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,947
straightforward to state algorithm and we
have this all, this design freedom,

200
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:08,835
forward focus in algorithm.
There's lots and lots of ways that we

201
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:14,430
could try to find augmenting paths and
there's even other methods that don't use

202
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:20,297
forward focus and that are almost as
simple. and the question is, how difficult

203
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:25,511
is it to solve the maxflow problem?
And there's literally hundreds of papers

204
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:30,930
in the scientific literature that are
oriented at trying to solve this problem.

205
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,410
Now, again the, the theoretical computer
scientists are trying to find an algorithm

206
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,852
that's guaranteed to work well in the
worst case.

207
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:45,473
So, they're just counting the number of
edges that the algorithms examine in the

208
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:49,267
worst case.
But when related to practical graphs these

209
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:54,887
are very, very conservative upper bounds.
And the real performance is going to be

210
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,822
totally different.
So, you can't use these to compare the

211
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:03,740
performance of a given algorithm.
The performance of a given algorithm

212
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,740
really depends on the characteristic of
networks.

213
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,220
But still, there's a huge gap between the
best algorithms that we know.

214
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:17,450
In a most recent one was discovered just
this,

215
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:25,413
This year that can guarantee e squared
over log e, number of edges examined to

216
00:19:25,413 --> 00:08:22,875
try to find maxflow. and so, that's fine
but there's a huge gap between, and very

217
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:41,648
small compared to say, shortest augmenting
path which is e cubed essentially.

218
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:49,101
And that's, that's fine, but actually in
practice, the running time of many of the

219
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:53,799
algorithms seems to be relatively small
factor of e,

220
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,328
And no one can prove that there might not
exist an algorithm, or no one has proved

221
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:04,856
yet, that there might not exist an
algorithm that gets the job done in linear

222
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,897
time.
So one of the exciting things about

223
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:13,287
studying the field of algorithms is
there's still room to find, to discover

224
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:18,884
interesting and innovative algorithms that
could have a huge practical impact.

225
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:24,067
Because we have algorithms that won't run
well on practical networks.

226
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:28,747
Lots and lots of important practical
applications use them.

227
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:34,480
And if someone, someone or discovered, to
discover a fast, practical, guaranteed

228
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,191
linear time algorithm, it would
immediately have huge impact.

229
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:43,824
So that's the first warning was worst case
order of growth.

230
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:47,828
You're not going to compare algorithms in
practice.

231
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:54,424
And there's plenty of research papers out
there that have done empirical studies on

232
00:20:54,424 --> 00:21:01,126
the maxflow algorithms for realistic
networks in the so-called ath, best so far

233
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:07,831
in practice is known as the push-relabel
method with gap relabeling, which runs in

234
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:11,503
time e square v, where e is the number of
edges.

235
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:17,730
And, again, even that in practical
networks is going to run faster than that.

236
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,309
So, there's numerous research challenges
still to be addressed in studying the

237
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:27,164
maxflow problem.
There's plenty of practitioners that are

238
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:33,278
using the codes like the one's that we've
shown and, and variations to try to solve

239
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:38,945
a huge real maxflow mincut problems and
trying to get them done in linear time.

240
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:44,021
There's many theoretical computer
scientist that are trying to prove that

241
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:49,490
there exists or not exists, a maxflow
algorithm that is guaranteed to run in

242
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:55,232
linear time, no matter what the input.
There's many, many people doing and

243
00:21:55,232 --> 00:22:01,043
there's still a great deal to be learned.
It's a fine example of why it's exciting

244
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:06,853
to be working in the field of algorithms.
There's, an opportunity for new knowledge

245
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:11,160
still available and many people are still
working on them.
