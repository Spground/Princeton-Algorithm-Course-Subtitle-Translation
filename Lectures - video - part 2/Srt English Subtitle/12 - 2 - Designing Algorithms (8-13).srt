1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,380
Now, we'll look at a couple of more
interesting examples that show how useful

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,175
reductions are for designing new
algorithms. so again that's the basic

3
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:21,657
definition and the implication of the
definition is that in order to design an

4
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:28,536
algorithm for a problem X. we can go ahead
and use some existing algorithm for Y. And

5
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:34,530
here's the, some of the many examples that
we've already seen in this course finding

6
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:41,670
the median and element distinctness. I
just talked about the scheduling problem,

7
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,236
reduces the topological sort. we saw that
in the shortest paths lecture. Also, the

8
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:54,310
arbitrage problem of is, involves building
a, a, a digraph for currency exchange. we

9
00:00:54,556 --> 00:01:00,465
reduce that to shortest paths. and there's
several other examples. So, it's an

10
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:06,505
important and useful technique. so that
just the general mentality is, if I know

11
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:12,110
how to solve Y, I have a new problem. can
I use that to solve X? and every

12
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,065
programmer does that and saying, well,
I've got some code that solves Y or I've

13
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:22,901
got a library function that does Y. Can I
use that to solve X? That's reduction. So,

14
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:28,889
our first example is convex hull problem
that we looked at briefly back in the

15
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:34,736
sorting lecture. And, and that's where
your given endpoints in the plane and what

16
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:40,160
you want to do is, I identify the points
on the periphery, these, that's called

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,836
extreme points on the convex hull. you can
imagine a, a bunch of points on a big

18
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:52,196
range and a rancher wants to use the
cheapest amount of fence to surround them

19
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:57,621
all. And so it's a minimum parameter way
to draw a line that surrounds all the

20
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:03,047
points, it's a convex hull. and there's
many other ways to define it. That doesn't

21
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:08,995
seem to be all that closely related to
sorting but it's actually true that convex

22
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:14,664
hull reduces the sorting. that is if you
can sort, you can compute the convex hull.

23
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:19,928
And that's an algorithm known as the
Graham scan algorithm that we'll look at

24
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:25,535
in the next slide. the cost of a convex
hull is the cost of the sort and log N

25
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,278
plus the cost of the reduction. And that
Graham scan algorithm just uses linear

26
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:36,748
time. So, with sorting we get an N log N
algorithm for convex hull, which is a nice

27
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:44,167
algorithm design technique. And this is a
diagram of the, that shows the Graham scan

28
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:51,572
algorithm we which we won't go through in
detail but it's pretty intuitive. what we

29
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:59,068
do is we pick a point one over in the
corner and maybe the smallest Y coordinate

30
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:06,640
point. and then, sort the points by polar
angle swept out by that coordinate. so, if

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,670
you think of a, of a line sweeping through
and just picking out the points by polar

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,559
angles centered at that point, then we get
the points in order along this polygon.

33
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:24,518
And because we're doing it by polar angle
the lines don't intersect. It's a simple

34
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:30,197
polygon which with no intersecting lines.
And then, the Graham scan algorithm is

35
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:37,061
just to proceed along, over here, it
proceeds along that polygon. but if you

36
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:42,413
ever come to a point where you are going
to make a right turn or clockwise turn you

37
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:47,254
throw out the points that would have
caused that. So, in this case, this point

38
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:52,414
will cause us to make a right turn so we
throw it out. And now, our most recent

39
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:57,447
points are these three. And again, that's
a right point, so we throw that one out

40
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:03,191
and it puts us in this position here and
so, and the idea is that any point that

41
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:07,554
would cause a right-hand turn is not going
to be on the convex hull. It's going to

42
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:13,352
kind of a, we kind of have a proof that
the points inside just buys into the fact

43
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:18,415
that it would make us do a right turn. So,
we throw this one out and that leaves that

44
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:23,388
and then we go here. And that would be a
right turn on the, on our path. So throw

45
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:28,438
that one out, and we're here. Another one
and continuing in this way. when we

46
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:33,550
finally get back to the beginning we've
computed the points on the convex hull.

47
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,796
So, the cost of the algorithm is the cost
of the sort which is N log N. But the cost

48
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:43,727
of the scan is only linear. Every point
only gets considered once. that's an

49
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:49,037
excellent example of a reduction to get a
new algorithm. If you didn't have the fast

50
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:55,715
sort this wouldn't be so effective. here's
another example of a reduction we

51
00:04:55,715 --> 00:05:02,652
implemented and looked at short est path
for digraphs. what about shortest paths on

52
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:09,025
undirected graphs? It still makes sense.
That's why I have a weighted undirected

53
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:15,640
graph with non-negative weights and I'm
going to find the shortest path from a

54
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,093
given vortex, source vortex, S2 or a given
target vortex T, and if it's the lowest

55
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:27,837
weight path from S to T. so how are we
gonna solve that one? We have shortest

56
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:33,512
path that works for digraphs. Well, if we
just replace each undirected edge by two

57
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:39,188
directed edges, then the shortest path
algorithm for digraphs works. in fact,

58
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:45,280
with our graph representation it's just
running that algorithm cuz our undirected

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,610
graphs are represented with the edges
going in both directions so they're

60
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,939
actually represented as digraphs. and
again, what's the cost? the cost this time

61
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:03,320
is the cost of pre-processing to just take
the graph in its undirected form and

62
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,854
convert it to directed form and then the
cost of shortest pass of the digraph is E

63
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:16,539
log V. So that gives us an algorithm for
shortest path in undirected graphs. Notice

64
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:22,829
that it doesn't work if there's negative
weights in the undirected graph, because

65
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:28,898
the reduction creates a negative cycle. it
is possible to find shortest paths in

66
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:35,227
these graphs but you need a, a much more
sophisticated algorithm to do it. so just

67
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:40,336
continuing in this way we've considered
quite a few problems that involved

68
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:45,577
reductions. so, I just talked about
finding median and element distinctness in

69
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:51,932
convex hull reducing to sorting. and there
were a bunch of other problems that we

70
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:57,893
considered as exercises when we talked
about applications to applications of

71
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:03,462
sorting. So, application of sorting really
means problem reduces to sorting. so sure

72
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:08,310
as processing time scheduling and, and,
and lots of other problems that are

73
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,135
reduced to sorting. and in the graph world
we looked at some pretty complicated

74
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:17,321
problems. Arbitrage we looked at a
parallel, parallel scheduling or CPM

75
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:22,612
method and I just talked about shortest
paths and undirected graphs and those all

76
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:29,688
reduced to shortest paths and digraphs. we
looked at problems that reduced to max

77
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:36,139
flow bipartite matching, reduces to max
flow and the linear program problem that

78
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:42,082
we'll talk about next time, actually both
max flow and shortest paths and digraphs

79
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,778
reduce to linear program programming. So
this is a pretty diversed set of problems

80
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:56,513
that all through the set of reduction we
found ways to solve them using some core

81
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:03,011
kinds of problem solving models. And so
reduction is an extremely important

82
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,100
algorithm design technique.
