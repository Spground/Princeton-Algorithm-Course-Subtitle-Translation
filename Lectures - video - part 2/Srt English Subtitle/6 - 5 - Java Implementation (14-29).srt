1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,983
Next, we're going to look at Java code for
solving the max flow problem.

2
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:14,476
This is the most complex.
Graph processing algorithm we have seen so

3
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:21,324
far but it's relatively a small amount of
curve that builds upon the mechanisms that

4
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:25,760
we have been studying for the last couple
of lectures.

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:33,075
So now, the graph that we are working with
little more complicated because we have to

6
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:37,900
associate with each edge not just the
capacity but also a flow.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,623
So, we'll build a slightly more
complicated data type for edges called a

8
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:47,744
flow edge.
Where, for each edge, we can keep track of

9
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:52,094
that information.
So, we not only have to keep the from

10
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:57,817
vertex V and the to vertex W.
The weight or the capacity C, associated

11
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:02,320
with the edge but, and also the flow cuz
that's a flow edge.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,892
And then the flow network.
Since we're going to go through edges in

13
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:13,922
the wrong direction we're going to have to
put every flow edge, kind of like an

14
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:20,358
undirected graph in both adjacency lists.
And then we're going to test whether we're

15
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:24,372
going, which direction we're going through
an edge.

16
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,905
It's kind of like using an undirected
graph.

17
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:34,569
But the flow network, anyway, has to have
edges in both places so it can do backward

18
00:01:34,569 --> 00:00:58,764
edges.
A simple way to arrange for this is to

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:44,524
compute for the edges what's called the
residual capacity, and that's just what

20
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:49,585
we're going to use to compute the
bottleneck value, the only max amount of

21
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:54,481
flow we can pull through.
So for the backward edge, we'll assign the

22
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,784
residualCapacityTo be the amount of flow.
And for the forward edge, it'll be the

23
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:04,204
capacity minus the flow.
So, that's the maximum amount of stuff we

24
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:09,778
can get through the edge when we're
augmenting its residual capacity. so and

25
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:15,650
to actually do the augmentation, you will
have a value which is your maximum that

26
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,258
you're going to, that you're going to
augment and so if you are on the forward

27
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:25,090
edge, you add it and if you're on a
backward edge, you subtract it.

28
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:30,080
And so, that's the basic idea and its just
quite natural from the graph

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,542
representation we've been using and the
way that the codes focus on how algorithm

30
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:40,810
woks.
So one way to think of this is to little

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:49,097
bit closer to the representation that
we're using, is to consider what's called

32
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:57,870
a residual network that for every edge
every forward edge in the network, it has

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,906
the, the in, forward edge going that has
the amount of flow left and a backward

34
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:13,314
edge with the amount of flow that's there.
And if you have a, a full forward edge, or

35
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:18,980
a, or an empty backward edge then you only
have one such.

36
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,878
So this an example of the residual network
for this amount of flow.

37
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:31,420
You can't put any more flow through from
this vertex to this vertex, so there's no

38
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,202
edge going that way.
But you can remove four units of flow

39
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:38,723
going that way.
So, that's because of the backward edge.

40
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,244
So and in this case we have a full forward
edge.

41
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:47,134
So, there's no edge going this way, cuz we
can't put any more flow through.

42
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,285
But there's nine going that way,
That's another example of a full forward

43
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,910
edge.
This empty one you can put eight units of

44
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,972
flow that way, so we have an edge in the
residual network going that way.

45
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:06,456
But no way to go that way, because there's
no flow, there's no backward edge.

46
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:12,843
And so this network is just a natural way
to look at the network while the flow is

47
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:17,887
being computed cause it's a digraph that
we're going to search to find the

48
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:21,951
augmenting path.
If a directed path in this network that's

49
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:28,327
from s to t, that's an augmenting path.
And that's a simple mechanism that helps

50
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:33,407
us write compact and elegant code.
So that's an augmenting path in the

51
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,286
original network and that just turns out
to be a directed path in the residual

52
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:42,537
network.
So then, we can just use our algorithms

53
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:48,140
that we've already studied for finding
directed paths in the residual network.

54
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,155
Alright, so here's the API for flow edges.
And they just have the few extra methods

55
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:01,786
to allow us to compute and make decisions
based on the amount of flow and capacity

56
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:06,257
in the edge.
These are the computations that we need to

57
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:12,194
implement the forward focus in algorithm.
So every edge has a from and a to.

58
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:18,670
If you have one point, it gives you the
other one which we need just as we did in

59
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,796
undirected graphs.
Every edge has capacity and a flow and a

60
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:28,332
residual capacity, which we compute from a
capacity in flow, then we want to be an

61
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:34,244
addResidualFlow to any edge, and its added
and if its forward, and it gets subtracted

62
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:39,892
if it's forward.
So those are the basic methods in the API

63
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:45,655
for a flow edge and, and the
implementation of all of them is

64
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:51,773
straightforward.
So notice that one thing that's a little

65
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:57,845
different from many othe, you know,
classes is that actually the goal of our

66
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:00,966
computation is to fill in these values
flow.

67
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:05,266
So, they're not final variables that's
what we're computing.

68
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:10,259
Now. we do it through addResidualFlow but
still it's not a final.

69
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:16,085
So, create an edge, just with a V to W
given capacity, just fill in the instance

70
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,900
variables and all these other ones are
just getters.

71
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:25,379
Others just like in an undirected graph.
And then, residualCapacity and

72
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,500
addResidualFlow are also easy to
implement.

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,937
So, residualCapacity if it's on the from
edge, you return the flow, if it's on the

74
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:38,703
to edge or it's the backward edge, you
return capacity minus flow, just as we

75
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:41,993
said.
And addResidualFlow makes the same test to

76
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,880
decide whether to add or subtract the
flow.

77
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,251
So very simple implementations of all
those operations for our flow edges in a

78
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:57,214
flow network.
So, what about the floor network, API?

79
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:05,072
it's again going to be our standard API,
just that floor graph, flow networks are

80
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:11,903
built from flow edges.
And they're going to be built for the

81
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:17,459
client which is going to be the max flow
algorithm. it's going to have a method

82
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,082
that gives an interval for every vertex of
all the forward and backward edges instant

83
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:27,920
on that vertex and sh, so that client is
going to use these basic things.

84
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,286
And given everything we've seen this
implementation is pretty straightforward.

85
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:40,330
It's pretty much just like edge-weighted
graph, except we use low edges now.

86
00:07:40,652 --> 00:02:35,484
And then, when we add an edge even though
it's kind of a directed network to handle

87
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:53,304
flow and forward and backward edges,
We add every edge to both adjacency lists.

88
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:58,220
But simple code, quite similar to what
we've seen before.

89
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:04,510
So we'll, again network is usually huge
and sparse.

90
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,857
So, we use a vertex index array and each
entry associated with each vertex will

91
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:17,364
contain references to all the edges that
are incident on that vertex whether

92
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:22,747
they're forward or backwards.
So, just like an un-directed graph, you

93
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:26,764
might have to, you'll have two references
to the same edge.

94
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:33,955
One and it's a from and the other and it's
to and then rather than just to wait, they

95
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:39,236
have a flow and a capacity.
So from zero to two, it's got capacity

96
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:44,436
three and one unit of flow in it.
So, that's an example of, of how to

97
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:48,985
represent that edge.
So, flow network has got flows in it,

98
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:53,616
that's the grey and it's got capacities,
and that's the white.

99
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:59,710
And otherwise, it's kind of similar to our
undirected graph representation.

100
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,674
I've got one more processing, the,,
processing the graph.

101
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:10,306
We use residualCapacity to make that kind
of work in the residual path in natural

102
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,478
way.
So, this is the implementation of the

103
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:18,145
forward focus in algorithm.
And again h, pretty straightforward to

104
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:24,239
given the description that we've done, and
the graph processing code that we've

105
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:30,356
written up to this time.
So it's got you have an array of vertices

106
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:36,310
that we've been to.
It's got an edge two array which is the

107
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:45,011
how do we get to each vertex so we can
provide the client with the flow so that

108
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:51,647
we can process paths in the graph you
know, it's got the value of the flow.

109
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:56,085
So, let's look at the code, it's kind of
self-documenting.

110
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,810
So what we'll do is we'll set the value of
the flow to zero.

111
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:07,851
So we're going to find out if it has a
augmenting path and we'll look at that

112
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:13,866
method in a minute.
As long as it has an augmenting path then

113
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:20,018
when we call, it has augmenting path,
basically what that's going to do is

114
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:26,898
that's going to do a graph search and mark
the verticies that it visits and if it

115
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:33,454
gets to this target, it's going to leave
that path and now the edge to array in the

116
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:40,313
standard way. the edge to of t contains
the, the edge that, that contains the

117
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:47,816
vertex that took us to t and so forth.
And so we'll use that edge to, to go back

118
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:52,544
through the path and to figure out the
bottleneck capacity,

119
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:58,898
Which is the minimum of the bottleneck
capacity and the residual capacity in the

120
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:05,977
high edge that we're processing.
So that's the, the maximum amount of flow

121
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:12,390
that we can push through the network does
go through the path and find the minimum

122
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:18,802
of either the unused capacity in some
forward edge or the available flow in some

123
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:23,077
backward edge.
So once we have the bottleneck capacity,

124
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:29,648
then we just go back through the path
again and addResidualFlow to every edge in

125
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,094
that path.
So that's augment the flow.

126
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:38,846
And then, once we've augment the flow,
then we update the value.

127
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:46,349
Notice that, when this terminates it
terminated because we couldn't find an

128
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:52,446
augmenting path, and we couldn't find an
augmenting path meant that, essentially,

129
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:59,436
we did a graph search that got stuck with
finding all full-forward edges or empty

130
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:04,567
backward edges before getting to the
target and that's precisely the

131
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:08,880
computation that we needed to do to
compute the cut.

132
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,598
So to tell whether a vertex is reachable
from s.

133
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:20,801
We just checkmarked v so we can tell the
client which vertices are in the cut.

134
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:28,460
And then we can find the, the edges that
leave that vertex with the edges that

135
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,185
comprise the cut. so now, all we have to
do to finish is to look that it has

136
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:39,477
augmenting path, which is the graph search
in the residual network.

137
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:45,536
And for this example we'll use
breadth-first search although the other

138
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:52,132
search algorithms that we've studied can
be adapted in the same way depth-first

139
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:58,344
search or using a priority queue as in
Prim's algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm.

140
00:12:58,574 --> 00:04:54,486
So we have our standard edge to in marked
arrays and so we already have a queue

141
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:12,420
which is going to contain the vertices
that we've encountered but not yet

142
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,918
visited.
We'll put the source on there while the

143
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:20,855
queue is not empty, we'll take a vertex
off.

144
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:27,696
And so, we'll go through everybody
associated that's connected to that

145
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:33,975
vertex, that's a flow edge.
And then, you check the residual capacity.

146
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,515
And if, if it's bigger than zero that
means h, you have a way to get to w, and

147
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:43,659
if it's not marked,
You haven't been there yet then you go

148
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:48,482
ahead and go there and mark it.
It's essentially a breadth-first search.

149
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,965
So that's the code for has augmenting
path.

150
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:59,653
And that essentially completes the
implementation of breadth-first search.

151
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:04,778
And mark t tells the, tells the returns
true or false.

152
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:11,900
If you can get from t to s after that
search is gone, then t will be marked, and

153
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,330
you can return true.
This method can return true.

154
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:20,500
That's a Java implementation of the max
flow.
