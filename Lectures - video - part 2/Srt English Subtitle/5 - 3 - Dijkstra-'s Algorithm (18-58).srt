1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,384
Now we'll look for, at Dijkstra's
algorithm for finding shortest paths in

2
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:13,878
graphs with non-negative edge weights.
Dijsktra is a famous figure in computer

3
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:17,810
science.
And you can amuse yourself by reading some

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,126
of the things that he wrote.
He was a very prolific writer, and, kept

5
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:27,422
notebooks.
And then here really some of his, famous

6
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,917
quotes.
Now, you need to may know something about,

7
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:37,107
old languages to appreciate some of these.
For example, COBOL was one of the first

8
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:43,493
business oriented languages, programming
languages and it tried to, make it so that

9
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:47,353
programs kind of read like English
language sentences.

10
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:54,287
But purists in computer science, such as
Dijkstra really didn't like that language

11
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,933
as you can tell,
The use of COBOL cripples the mind.

12
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:02,580
It's teaching should therefore be regarded
as a criminal offense.

13
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:07,773
Actually, when I first came to Princeton
and was setting up the department here,

14
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:13,027
One of, there was a big donor, who
actually, wanted to have me fired and the

15
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:16,448
department closed down because we wouldn't
teach COBOL.

16
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,625
I didn't know about Dijkstra's quote at
that time,

17
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,473
I wish I had.
And there's some other opinions that

18
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:27,682
Dijkstra had.
You can amuse yourself on the web, reading

19
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:32,386
some of his writing,
But he was, here's another one that's

20
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:37,668
actually pretty relevant today.
Object-oriented programming is an

21
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:43,362
exceptionally bad idea that could only
have originated in California.

22
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:50,046
Dijkstra worked in Texas, the University
of Texas for a while, and of course, came

23
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,450
from the Netherlands.
Okay.

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,905
But, Dijkstra, did, invent, a very, very
important algorithm, that's very widely

25
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:03,590
used for solving the shortest paths
problem.

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,207
It's the one that's in your maps app and
in your, car, and many, many other

27
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:15,149
applications.
So let's take a look at how that algorithm

28
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:18,332
works.
It's a very simple algorithm.

29
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:23,610
We, consider, what we're going to do is
consider the vertices

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,390
In increasing order of their distance from
the source.

31
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:34,620
So and a way we're going to do that is
take the next vertex, add it to the tree

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,150
and relax all the edges that point from
that vertex.

33
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,940
So let's talk about it in terms of a demo
and then we'll look at the code.

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,348
So our mandate is to consider vertices in
increasing order of distance from the

35
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:58,558
source.
So, our source is zero in this case so

36
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:08,134
what vertices are closest to the source?
Well, we can look at the edges that point

37
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:12,529
from that vertex.
Well, start out with vertex is zero, is

38
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:15,689
the distance zero from the source, so we
pick it.

39
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:21,023
Then we add that vertex to the shortest
paths tree, and relax all its edges.

40
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:26,488
And relaxing all the edges pointing from
zero in this case is just going to uptake

41
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:30,380
the, this two and edgeTo entries for five,
eight, nine.

42
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,687
So in this case, this says that the
shortest path from zero to one is to go

43
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:42,604
along zero, one and that's distance five
and from zero to four, it's to go along

44
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:48,319
zero, four and that's distance nine, And
zero to seven, let's go take it zero,

45
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,350
seven that's distance eight.
And the edge weights are positive.

46
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:59,682
We're not going to find a shorter path to
anyone, of what,

47
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:02,998
Sorry.
The edge weights are positive and those

48
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,991
are the shortest paths that we know so far
to the vertices.

49
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:11,390
Now, the first key point of the algorithm
is take the closest one.

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,619
If you take the closest one, in this case,
it's one, Then we know we're not going to

51
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:21,703
find a shorter, shorter path to one.
The only other way to go out of zero is to

52
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:25,091
take one of these other edges, and they're
longer.

53
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:30,435
So, and all the edge weights are positive.
So we're not going to find a shorter way

54
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,433
from zero to one, than to take the edge,
0-1.

55
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,148
So that means that edge 0-1 is on the
shortest path tree,

56
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:41,514
That's what the algorithm says.
Take the next closest vertex to the

57
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,577
source. in this case, it's one.
And then,

58
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,894
We're going to add that edge, that vertex
to the tree.

59
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:52,560
And relax all the edges that point from
that.

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,976
So now both zero and one are on the tree,
so now let's look at the edges pointing to

61
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,290
that and we have to relax each one of
those.

62
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:08,300
So in this case if you go from one to
four, Then we look at four, we know a path

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,222
of length nine.
And one to four doesn't give us a shorter

64
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:17,658
path, so we leave that edge alone.
One to three gives us a shorter path to

65
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:23,445
three which is going to be twenty, cuz you
went from zero to one, and then one to

66
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:28,323
three is of length twenty.
And one to two, also, we didn't know a way

67
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:33,273
to two, But now we know now we know one,
or better one is seventeen.

68
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:38,658
So that completes the relaxation of all
the edges pointing from one.

69
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,203
So now we have zero and one on the tree,
And.

70
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:49,859
We would, consider next,
The next closest vertex to the source.

71
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:55,449
So what we have in this two is the
shortest paths to all the vertex, vertices

72
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,571
that we've seen so far and this one says
that the we've been to the zero and one so

73
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:07,085
the next closest one is seven, which is
distance eight.

74
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:13,444
So we are going to choose vertex seven.
And again, that's the shortest path we've

75
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:19,086
seen so far, we are not going to find a
shorter one cuz to get to every other

76
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:24,425
vertex is longer. and so, we know it's on
the shortest paths tree, and now we're

77
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,776
going to relax all the edges pointing from
seven.

78
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,777
In this case, both of them, the one from
seven to two, gives us a shorter way to

79
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:38,459
two than what we knew before, and the one
from seven to five gives us a shorter way

80
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,772
to five than we knew before.
Well, we hadn't been to five before.

81
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:46,880
So that relaxes seven, so now seven is on
the shortest paths tree.

82
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:51,461
So now 4's the next closest path vertex to
the source.

83
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:54,720
From the edge zero, four which is of
length nine.

84
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:59,460
So that's the one that we're going to pick
next for the tree.

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,954
We're not going to find a shorter path
there,

86
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:08,546
And we relax, relax along all its edges.
In this case, we find a shorter path to

87
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:14,525
five than we knew before and a shorter
path to six, well, we visit six for the

88
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:19,869
first time.
Okay, so that's four, so now we just have

89
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:26,054
to worry about two, three, five, and six,
and five is the one over there, and so we

90
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:33,212
select vertex five, Relax along its edges.
In this case those edges both give us

91
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:39,265
better paths than we knew before.
So now we're left with three vertices, and

92
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:43,695
two is the winner.
This is the two from the sources fourteen,

93
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:50,820
To three, it's twenty and to six, it's 26.
Relax it's edges, and it gives us again,

94
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,733
new shorter paths to both three and six.
And then the last, this next to last step

95
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:07,010
is to pick three and that does not give us
a new way to six, and then finally we pick

96
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,830
six.
And then we now know,

97
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:15,413
The shortest path to all the vertices from
vertex zero.

98
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:22,048
If we just take the edgeTo edges,
That's from one, to one you take zero, to

99
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:28,578
five you take two, And so forth you get
the shortest paths tree and that gives the

100
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:32,652
shortest way to get from the source to
every vertex.

101
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:36,100
That's a simulation of Dijkstra's
algorithm.

102
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,405
Here's a demo of Dijsktra's algorithm
running in a large digraph.

103
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:49,499
So the source is the protects the center
with the open circle and you can see it

104
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:55,940
considers the vertices in the graph in
order of their distance from the source.

105
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,566
Now you can see this is maybe like a lake
in the middle of the graph,

106
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:06,132
And so it's not going to move on from
those vertices.

107
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:10,535
It's going to take a little while to get
around the lake.

108
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,041
And again, if, this visualization is
produced by our code,

109
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:22,518
Then it, and it gives a very, natural
feeling for the way that the algorithm

110
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:26,565
works,
This, in principle. And I think, in fact,

111
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:32,556
in many cases, is what your, car does when
you turn the map system on,

112
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:36,118
It computes the shortest path to
everywhere,

113
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:42,351
And then it's all ready when you ask for a
certain place, how to get there.

114
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:47,453
So here's just, starting from another
point in the graph.

115
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:53,718
You have, if you happen to live at a
corner of the Earth, then it's going to be

116
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,310
slightly longer to get to the other
corner.

117
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,490
And, a nice feeling for how the algorithm
gets its job done.

118
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,006
Again, when it gets into those blank
areas, it takes a little while to get over

119
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:14,018
to the other side.
And of course if we had islands, if we had

120
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:18,780
little roads in the middle there that were
not connected,

121
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,768
Then we know where to get to them from the
source and we wouldn't see them.

122
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:27,616
And that's fine for the way our algorithm
works.

123
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:34,172
We just leave that out of the demo and the
proof to avoid adding an extra comment

124
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:39,445
about that for every algorithm.
That's a visualization of Dijkstra's

125
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:44,077
algorithm on a large graph.
So, so how do we prove it's correct?

126
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:49,707
Well, essentially we've prove that it's an
instance of the generic algorithm.

127
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:55,560
So, first thing is that every edge is
relaxed exactly once.

128
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,320
Every time we, everytime we put a vertex
onto the tree, we relax all the edges that

129
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,080
come from that vertex and we never
reconsider the vertex.

130
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,336
And what does relaxation do?
Relaxation ensures that after the

131
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:17,805
relaxation, either way there was before,
afterwards, you have the distance to w is

132
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:24,355
less than or equal the distance to v plus
e to the, e plus the way to the edge.

133
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:31,714
Either it's equal cuz we just made it that
way, or it's less than it was before and

134
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:37,374
the edge was not relevant.
And this inequality is going to hold for

135
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:44,005
every an, entry for every edge
corresponding to every edge, for just two

136
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:50,732
entries corresponding to every edge
because number one, the, these two values

137
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:56,251
are always increasing.
We never I'm sorry, we're always

138
00:11:56,251 --> 00:12:00,303
decreasing.
The only thing we ever change, only reason

139
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,705
we ever change distTo w is to make it
smaller.

140
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:09,205
If we, if we found an edge that would make
it bigger we ignor that edge,

141
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:14,054
So it's always decreasing.
So when we change distTo w, we're not

142
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:18,758
going to make that inequality holds.
We're just going to make it better.

143
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,450
And this distTo v is not going to change
at all.

144
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,058
Once we relax an edge from a vertex, we're
done with that vertex.

145
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:33,667
We're not going to process that at all.
So, then when we're done we have the

146
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:39,352
optimality conditions hold that exactly is
the optimality condition.

147
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:44,807
And, not only that, we have a path from
the source to every vertex.

148
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:50,339
So that's the correctness proof for
Dijkstra's algorithm based on the

149
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,549
optimality conditions.
Here's the code.

150
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,547
It's similar to code that we've seen
before.

151
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:04,745
We're going to use the indexed priority
queue that allows us to implement the

152
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:10,503
decreased key operation.
And we have our edgeTo and distTo arrays

153
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:17,140
that are part of the shortest paths
computation and the goal of the shortest

154
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,778
paths computation.
So we initialized the constructor,

155
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,895
initializes those rays and including the
Index

156
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:33,451
Minimum PQ. and we start out with all the
distances infinity except for the distance

157
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:39,426
of the source is zero.
We put the source on the priority Q and

158
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:48,716
then what we're going to do is take the,
Edge that closest to the source off the

159
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:52,484
priority.
That's on the priority queue off and then

160
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:58,467
relax all the edges that are adjacent to
that, so I'm using our standard iterator

161
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:04,303
to get all the edges that emanate from
that vertex and relax them. And then the

162
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:10,435
relax code is just like the code that was
showed when describing relaxation, except

163
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:16,849
that it also updates the priority queue.
If the, vertex, that, that edge goes to is

164
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:21,277
on the priority queue, it gives a new
shorter way to get to that,

165
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,151
So we have to, decrease the key on the
priority queue,

166
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:29,025
Cuz if it's not on the priority queue, we
insert it,

167
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:32,899
And that's it.
That's a complete implementation, of

168
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,290
Dijsktra's algorithm using modern data
structures.

169
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:41,884
Now, this algorithm might seem very
familiar than, if you've been paying

170
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:45,269
attention.
It's essentially the same algorithm as

171
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,413
Prim's algorithm.
The difference is that, in both cases,

172
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:53,420
we're building what's called a spanning
tree of the graph.

173
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:58,782
But in Prim's algorithm, we take a vertex
that, that's not on the tree using the

174
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:03,703
rule of let's take the vertex that's
closest to the tree, anywhere on the tree,

175
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:08,246
Closest to some vertex on the tree.
For Dijsktra's algorithm, we take next,

176
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:13,377
the vertex that's closest to the source
through a path, they go through a tree and

177
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:17,910
then into a non-tree vertex.
That's the difference and the differences

178
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,939
in the code have to do with the fact that
Prim's algorithm is for an undirected

179
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,858
graph, Dijsktra's algorithm is for a
directed graph,

180
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,528
But essentially, they're the same
algorithm.

181
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:33,495
And actually, several of the algorithms
that we've talked about are in this same

182
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:36,036
family.
They compute a spanning tree.

183
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:42,572
I have, you, you have a tree that takes
care of where that records where you've

184
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:46,566
been in the graph,
From every vertex, back to where you

185
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:50,372
started.
Then you used different rules for choosing

186
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:55,147
which vertex to add next.
For breadth-first search, you use a Q, for

187
00:15:55,147 --> 00:16:01,341
depth-first search, you use something like
a stack and then you have to decide what

188
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:05,744
to do, if you encounter a vertex that
you've been to before.

189
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:09,550
But many graph algorithms use this same
basic idea.

190
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:15,401
So in particular, when we are talking
about what the running time of Dijsktra's

191
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:19,720
algorithm, it depends on what priority Q
the implementation we use,

192
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:23,900
And it's the same considerations as for
Prim's algorithm.

193
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:30,331
We have V insert operations, every vertex
goes on to the priority queue. V

194
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:35,730
delete-min, every vertex comes off the
priority queue. and for every edge, in the

195
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,700
worst case, we could compute decrease-key
operation.

196
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,992
So, the original implementations of
Dijsktra's algorithm used an unordered

197
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:50,043
array,
Which would mean that it would take time

198
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:56,248
proportional to V to find the minimum,
To find the vertex closest to the source.

199
00:16:56,852 --> 00:17:02,110
So the total running time would be
proportional to V squared.

200
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:08,272
That's not adequate for the huge sparse
graph that we see in practice today like

201
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:13,483
the map in your car.
So, the binary heap data structure, makes

202
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:17,581
the,, makes it feasible to run this
algorithm.

203
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:23,153
And that's where all the operations take
time proportional to log V.

204
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:29,381
We have to use the indexing trick that we
talked about last time to support

205
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,888
decrease-key.
But still, we get a total running time of

206
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,510
E log V,
Which makes it feasible.

207
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,940
And just as with Prim's algorithm, by
using a implementation of the priority

208
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,093
queue that can do a faster decrease-key,
you can get a faster algorithm.

209
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:53,827
And in, in practice something like a 4-way
hit is going to give quite a fast

210
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:57,601
algorithm.
And so, more expensive to insert and t-,

211
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:02,319
to insert but much faster to delete min in
decrease key.

212
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:08,126
And again, there's a theoretical data
structure that's not useful in practice.

213
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:11,610
It gets the running time down to E + V log
V.

214
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,292
Of course, if your graph, graph is dense,
And again, the examples I used, they're

215
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:20,843
not.
The array implementation is optimal, we

216
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:25,176
can't do any better.
We have to go through all the edges and

217
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:28,798
might as well find the minimum, at the
same time.

218
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:33,983
But in, in, in practice, people use binary
heaps, for sparse graphs.

219
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:39,097
I maybe going to four way,
If, the performance is really critical.

220
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:45,623
The bottom line is, we have, extremely
efficient implementations for the huge

221
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:48,140
graphs that arise in practice nowadays.
