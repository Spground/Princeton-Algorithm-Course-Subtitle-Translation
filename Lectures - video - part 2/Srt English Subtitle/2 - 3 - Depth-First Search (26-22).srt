1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,253
Now, we're going to look at depth-first
search, which is a classical graph

2
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:11,001
processing algorithm.
It's actually maybe one of the oldest

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:17,042
algorithms that we study, surprisingly.
One way to think about depth first search,

4
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:21,421
is in terms of mazes.
It's a pretty familiar way to look at,

5
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,354
look at it.
And, so, if you have a maze like the one

6
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:29,140
drawn on the left, you can model it with a
graph.

7
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:32,490
By creating a vertex for every
intersection.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,482
In the maze.
And an edge for every passage connecting

9
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,265
two intersections.
And.

10
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,972
So.
If you're at the entrance to this maze and

11
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:47,390
you want to find a pot of gold somewhere.
What you're gonna need to do is.

12
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:51,667
Explore every intersection.
Or explore, explore every edge.

13
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,164
In the maze.
So.

14
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:57,442
We're gonna talk about the.
Explore every intersection.

15
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,723
Option.
So that's our goal.

16
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:06,176
To have an algorithm for doing that.
By the way, this is a famous graph that

17
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:12,840
some of you might recognize.
That's the graph for the Pac-man game.

18
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:22,256
Okay, so one method classic method that
predates computers for exploring a maze is

19
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:26,588
called the Tr maux maze exploration
algorithm.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,955
The idea is to think about having a ball
of string.

21
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:39,769
And what you do is when you walk down a
passage, you unroll the string behind you.

22
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,791
And you also, mark, every place that
you've been.

23
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:48,101
So actually, I have a ball of string and
some chalk, maybe.

24
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,909
So in this case, maybe we walk down this
passage here.

25
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,716
And now we have some choices about where
we might go.

26
00:01:55,931 --> 00:02:00,744
So say we go down here.
So we unroll our ball of string and mark

27
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:03,476
it.
And so now, the next time, At this

28
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:06,830
intersection, we have no choice but to go
up here.

29
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:10,443
We go up here and we say, oh, we've
already been there.

30
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:13,734
So we're not gonna go there.
And we come back.

31
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:18,701
And, we have our ball of string.
So we can unroll it to figure out where we

32
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,798
were.
And we go back until we have some other

33
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:24,314
choice.
Which is this, this place, now.

34
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:30,121
And we mark that we've been in these other
places, And so now, we take another option

35
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:34,508
and say, go down this way.
And here, we take another option, go that

36
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:38,385
way.
And then finally again we go up this a way

37
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:44,115
and we see that we've been there so we
back up and take the last option and then

38
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:48,135
that gets us to the last vertex in the
graph.

39
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:54,118
So mark each visited intersection and each
visited package, passage, and retrace our

40
00:02:54,118 --> 00:03:01,393
steps when there's no unvisited option.
Again this is a classical algorithm that

41
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:10,203
was studied centuries ago and in fact some
argued the first youth was when Theseus

42
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:18,317
entered the Labyrinth and was trying to
find the Minotaur and, And Rodney didn't

43
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:23,775
want ''em to get lost in the maze.
So she instructed Theseus to use a ball of

44
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:29,034
string to find his way back out.
That's the basic algorithm that we're

45
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:32,955
gonna use.
And has been studied by many, many

46
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:39,993
scientists in the time since Theses.
And in fact, Claude Shannon, founder of

47
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:46,855
Information Theory, did experiments on
mazes with mice to see if they might

48
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:50,990
understand maze exploration, this might
help.

49
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:57,080
Okay, so here's what it look like in its
typical maze.

50
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:04,487
Now one of the things to remember is in a
computer representation normally we're

51
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:09,210
just looking at the vertices and the set
of associated edges.

52
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:14,098
We don't see anything other than that.
Though, it's sometimes frustrating

53
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:19,584
watching me you know that it turned the
wrong way and it's gonna get trapped here.

54
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:24,812
But, the computer doesn't really know
that, so it has to back up along here now

55
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:30,170
and it continues to back up to find
another option untill it gets free again.

56
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,215
And finds a some place to go.
Sometimes its very frustrating.

57
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:41,332
Its seems to be quite close to the goal
like appear and it turns a wrong way.

58
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:48,060
So we an see its gonna take a long way but
no way the program could really know that.

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,588
Again, all the programs we're working with
is vertex instead of edges associated with

60
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:59,641
that vertex and there it finally get to
the goal.

61
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:13,721
Here's a bigger one going faster.
The king thing is not so much, its getting

62
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,590
lost and the key thing is not going
anywhere twice.

63
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:23,234
And that's the whole thing.
We have to have the string to know to go

64
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:27,617
back where we came from.
And we have to be able to mark where we

65
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:30,627
have been.
And with those two things we are,

66
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:34,160
algorithm is, able to avoid going the same
place twice.

67
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:40,031
If you weren't marking, if you tried to do
this randomly or some other way it might

68
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:45,111
take you a while to get to the goal.
So it doesn't seem like much of

69
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:50,587
accomplishment maybe for a maze but
actually to be able to get there with

70
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:56,260
going, without going any place thrice,
twice is sort of a, profound idea and

71
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,239
leads to an efficient algorithm.
Okay.

72
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:07,358
So, our idea is, given in this, medicode,
to do, depth research, that is, to, visit,

73
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,459
all the places you can get to from a
vertex, V.

74
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,565
What we're gonna do is this simple re,
recursive algorithm.

75
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:23,344
Mark the vertex as visited and then
recursively visit all unmarked vertices, W

76
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:28,493
that are adjacent to V.
That's a very simple description, and it

77
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:33,973
leads to very simple codes.
It's so simple actually, it really belies

78
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,520
the profound idea underneath this
algorithm.

79
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:43,735
So, again, There's lots of applications.
And, for example, this is one way to find

80
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:47,120
whether there exists a path between two
vertices.

81
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:51,678
Or to find all the vertices connected to a
given source vertex.

82
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:57,134
And we'll consider some less abstract
applications, once we've looked at the

83
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:59,779
code.
So, so how to implement.

84
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:06,756
Well here's what we're gonna do for our
design pattern for graph processing.

85
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:14,350
It's our first example.
So what we did, when we defined an API for

86
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:21,510
graph was to decouple the graph data type
from graph processing.

87
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,174
The idea is we're gonna create a graph
object using that API which we know allows

88
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:30,489
us to represent a big graph within the
computer.

89
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:35,808
And gives us the basic operations that
we're gonna need for graph processing.

90
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:39,883
And then we use that API within a graph
processing routine.

91
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:45,340
And the basic idea is that, that graph,
graph processing routine will go through

92
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,728
the graph and collect some information.
And then a client of that routine will

93
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:55,080
query the it's API to get information
about the graph.

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,339
So in the case of, depth first search.
Here's a potential possible API.

95
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:10,716
So the idea is that what this, what we're
gonna implement is a program that can find

96
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:17,420
paths in a graph from a given source.
So we give a graph and a vertex.

97
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:24,275
And that the constructor is gonna do what
it needs in order to be able to answer,

98
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,926
these two queries.
First one is, give a vertex,

99
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:34,394
Client will give a vertex.
Is there a path in the graph, from the

100
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:39,065
source to that vertex?
You wanna be able to, answer that

101
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,834
efficiently.
And then,

102
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:47,249
The other thing is to just give the path.
What's the path from, has to be giving all

103
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:51,894
the vertices on the path, in time
proportional to its length.

104
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:58,456
So here's a client of, this, API.
So, it's gonna take a source, a source

105
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:02,554
vertex S.
And it's gonna build a pathfinder, or a

106
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:07,397
path object.
And that object is gonna do the processing

107
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:13,913
it needs to be able to efficiently
implement hasPathTo. And then what this

108
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:20,900
does is for every vertex in the graph.
If there's a path from s to that vertex.

109
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:24,157
It'll print it out.
So it prints out all the vertices

110
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:29,108
connected to x.
And that's just one client, of this, data

111
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:33,035
type.
You could, print out the pass or whatever

112
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:37,415
else you might.
So that's our design pattern that we're

113
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:42,001
gonna use over and over again, for, A
graph processing routine.

114
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,712
And it's important to understand why we
use a design pattern like this.

115
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:51,224
We're decoupling the graph representation
from the processing of it.

116
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:56,333
As I mentioned, there's hundreds of
routines for, or algorithms that have been

117
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,978
developed for processing graphs.
An alternative might be to put all of

118
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:06,500
those algorithms in one big data type.
That's a so called fat interface.

119
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:12,714
And that would be a, a bad plan, cuz these
things maybe are not so well related to

120
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:17,072
each other.
And actually all of them really are just

121
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:22,286
iterating through the graph, and doing
different types of processing.

122
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:28,067
With this way we're able to separate out.
The, and I articulate what the graph

123
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:32,599
processing clients are doing.
And then the real applications can be

124
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,711
clients, of these graph processing
routines.

125
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:41,460
And everybody's taken advantage of an
efficient representation, that we already

126
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,925
took care of.
Okay.

127
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:49,220
So now let's look at a demo of how
depth-first search is gonna work and then

128
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,734
we'll take a look at the implementation.
Okay.

129
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:58,663
So here's a demo of depth-first search in
operation on our sample graph.

130
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:04,592
Again, to visit a vertex we're gonna mark
it, and then recursively visit all

131
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:07,740
unmarked verti-, vertices that are
adjacent.

132
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:14,168
So this is a sample graph.
And so the first thing we do is realize

133
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:21,090
that we're gonna need a vertex index array
to keep track of which vertices are more.

134
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:28,590
So that will just be an array of bullions
and we'll initialize that with all false.

135
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,871
We're also gonna keep another data
structure.

136
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:40,365
A, a vertex indexed array of ints.
That for every vertex gives us the vertex

137
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:45,870
that took us there.
So, let's get started and you'll see how

138
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,992
it works.
So this is depth-first search staring at

139
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:54,659
vertex zero.
So now to visit vertex zero, we wanna mark

140
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,570
it so that's, our mark zero is true.
That's the starting points we know

141
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,770
anything with Edge two.
And now what we're gonna do is.

142
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,044
We're going to need to check all the
vertices that are adjacent to zero.

143
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:15,465
So that's six, two, one, and five.
The order in which they're checked depends

144
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:20,886
on the representations in the bag.
We don'tr really, necessarily care about

145
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:24,329
that.
Most of the algorithms are going to check

146
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:28,065
them all.
And it doesn't matter that much about the

147
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:31,361
order.
Although, in some cases it's wise to be

148
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:35,097
mindful.
And maybe use a bag that takes them out in

149
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:38,046
random order.
Okay this is zero.

150
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:44,451
Now we have to check, six, two, one, and
five so, lets go ahead and do that.

151
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:49,276
So in this case six, six is the first
thing to get checked.

152
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:56,762
And so now, we mark, six is visited so now
we are going to recursively do a search

153
00:12:56,762 --> 00:13:01,466
starting from six.
The other difference when we visit six

154
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:05,665
from zero.
We're going to put a zero in this edge to

155
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:11,926
entry to say that when we first got the
six the way we got there, was from zero.

156
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:18,187
And that's going to be the data structure
that'll help us, implement the client

157
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:22,310
query and give us the path back to zero
from any path.

158
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,317
From any vertex.
So okay what do we have to do to visit

159
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:29,564
six.
Well six has two adjacent vertices zero

160
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:32,535
and four.
So we're gonna have to check them.

161
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:36,127
So first we check zero and that's already
marked.

162
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:42,000
So we don't really have to do anything.
We're only suppose to recursively visit

163
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
unmarked vertices.
And then we check four.

164
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,510
And four is unmarked, so we're going to
have to recursively visit is.

165
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,981
The next thing we do is visit four.
Mark four as having been visited.

166
00:13:55,981 --> 00:14:01,855
Where the true and the marked array,
Fourth entry is a marked array.

167
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:06,280
And we fill an edge two saying we got to
four from six.

168
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:13,566
And so now to visit four, we have to
recursively check five, six and three, and

169
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:18,070
again, that order is where they happen to
be in our bag.

170
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:23,719
So first we check five.
Five is not marked so we're going to visit

171
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,602
five.
We're gonna mark it.

172
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:31,477
Say we got there from four, and then go
ahead and visit three, four and zero, in

173
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:34,716
that order.
From first we visit three.

174
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:40,064
That one also is not yet marked, so we're
gonna recursively visit it.

175
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,261
So it's marked three.
Say we got there from five and then go

176
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:50,610
ahead and to visit three recursively, we
have to check five and four.

177
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:54,096
Check five.
Well we just came here it's mark, so we

178
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:58,640
don't have to do anything.
Check four, that's also, been marked so we

179
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,060
don't have to do anything.
So now finally, this is the first time and

180
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,165
that requires a call that we're ready to
return, we're done with that first search

181
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,393
from three.
So now we're done with three.

182
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:18,150
And we can unwinding the recursion, we can
now continue our search from five.

183
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,218
And the next thing we have to do from
five, we had already checked three, so now

184
00:15:23,218 --> 00:15:27,113
we're gonna check four.
And we've already visited four, so we

185
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:30,080
don't have to do anything.
That's already marked.

186
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,356
And we checked zero, and that one's
already marked.

187
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:38,240
So now we're done with five, and we can
back one more level up in the recursion.

188
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:42,752
So now, for four, we have to go through,
and look at six and three.

189
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:46,214
Six is mar, marked, so we don't have to do
anything.

190
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:51,530
Three is marked, so we don't have to do
anything, and so we're gonna be done with

191
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,684
four.
So that after finishing four we're done

192
00:15:55,684 --> 00:16:00,391
with six.
And so now we're in the recursion back at

193
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:03,607
zero.
And we've already checked six.

194
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:09,349
So now we gotta check two next.
We checked two, and so we rehearse and go

195
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:13,034
there.
Mark two, and then say we got there from

196
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:19,126
zero, and now to visit two, all we check
is zero and that's a marks, so we don't

197
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:22,435
have to do anything, and we're done with
two.

198
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,624
Then check one, visit one, that's the last
vertex we're visiting.

199
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:32,073
Check zero, it's already marked so we
don't do anything.

200
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:36,436
We return.
Now, we're at the last, step is to, from

201
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:40,798
zero, five is on it's list, we have to
check if we've been there.

202
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:46,130
We can see that it's marked and we have
been there so we're one with zero.

203
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:55,649
So that's a depth-first search from vertex
zero, and we have visited all the vertices

204
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:01,700
that are reachable from zero.
Number one and number two for each one of

205
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,014
those vertexes we kept track of how we got
there from zero.

206
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:12,083
So if we now want to know for any one of
those vertices how to get back to zero we

207
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:18,005
have the information that we need.
For example say we want to find the path

208
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:23,197
from five back to zero.
We know we got the five from four, we know

209
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:28,973
we got the four from six, we know we got
the six from zero so we can go back

210
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:35,155
through using that edge to array to find.
The path, so the depth for search

211
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:41,563
calculation built in data structures, and
now clients, whose data structures built

212
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:48,250
in a constructor serve as the basis for,
being able to.

213
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,760
Officially answer client queries.
That's a depth-first search demo.

214
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,247
So, this is just a summary of the thing I
talked about, during that demo.

215
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,450
Our goal is to find all the vertices
connected to different vertex at.

216
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,570
And also a path, in order to be able to
answer client query.

217
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,117
On the algorithm we're going to use is
based on like maze exploration where we

218
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:20,393
use excursion, mark each vertex, keep
track of the edge we took to visit it and

219
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:26,843
return when there's no unvisited options.
We're using, two data structures, to

220
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:30,655
implement this.
Both vertex indexed arrays.

221
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,161
One named Mark that will tell us which
vertices we've been to.

222
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:41,413
And another one, edge two that maintains
that tree of paths.

223
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:48,190
Where edge 2W = V means that VW was taken,
the first time that we went to W.

224
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,844
So now, let's look at the code, that,
given all of this background.

225
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:57,935
The code for implementing depth first
search is remarkably compact.

226
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:02,953
So here's our private instance variables.
The marked and edgedTo vertex and mix

227
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:08,117
arrays, and the source s.
And the constructor just goes through and,

228
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:13,644
creates, the arrays and initializes them.
And we won't repeat that code.

229
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:20,334
And so here's the, the last thing the
constructor does after it creates the

230
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:25,197
arrays, is does a DFS on the graph, from
the given source.

231
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:31,213
And it's a remarkably, compact
implementation to do depth-first search,

232
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,569
from a vertex V.
What we do is mark V, let's say mark it

233
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,701
true.
Then for everybody adjacent to V.

234
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:45,387
We check if it's marked.
If it's not marked, then we do a recursive

235
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:49,649
call.
And we set edge to w equals v.

236
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:56,280
Again remarkably compact code that gets
the job done.

237
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:02,388
So now let's look at some of the
properties of depth-first search.

238
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:09,409
So first thing is we wanna be sure that
convince ourselves that it marks all the

239
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:14,919
vertices connected to S in time
proportional to some of their degrees,

240
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,845
well, depth-first graph is going to be
small.

241
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,960
So s-, so first thing is, convince
yourself that if you mark the vertex, then

242
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,810
there has to be a way to get to that
vertex from S.

243
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:34,779
So well that's easy to see, because the
only way to mark vertex is get there

244
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:40,976
through a sequence of recursive calls, and
every recursive calls corresponds to an

245
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:46,344
edge on a path from SVW.
But you also have to be able to show that

246
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:50,215
you get to, every vertex that's connected
to S.

247
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:56,692
And that's a little more intricate.
And this diagram is, supposed to help you

248
00:20:56,692 --> 00:21:02,379
out in understanding that.
If you had, some unmarked vertex, Then,

249
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:06,250
maybe there's, a bunch of unmarked
vertices.

250
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,130
And so...
And it's connected to S and it's not

251
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:17,047
marked, so that means there has to be an
edge on a path from S to W, that goes from

252
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:22,604
a marked vertex to an unmarked one.
But the design of the algorithm says that

253
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:27,407
there's no such edge if you're on a marked
vertex then you're gonna go through and

254
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:31,690
look at all the adjacent ones and if it's
not marked, you're gonna mark it.

255
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,965
So that's an outline of the proof that DFS
marks all the vertices.

256
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:43,199
And in the running time, it only visits
each marked vertex once or each vertex

257
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:47,515
connected as once.
And so, for each one of them, it goes

258
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:52,951
through all the adjacent vertices.
So that's the basic properties of

259
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:58,323
depth-first search.
So now, the other thing that is important

260
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:04,894
is that a client who has, uses this
algorithm after the depth-first search,

261
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:11,554
after the constructor has done the
depth-first search and built these data

262
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:16,260
structures,
Client can find the vertices connected to

263
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,298
the source in constant time.
And can find a path, 2S if one exists in

264
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:29,459
time proportional to its length.
Well, the marked array provides the first

265
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:35,811
part.
And the second part is Just the property

266
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:41,781
of the edge to array.
It's a, what's called a parent link

267
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:49,774
representation of a tree rooted at S.
So if a vertex is connected to S then its

268
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:54,530
edge two is parent in a tree.
So this code here.

269
00:22:54,754 --> 00:23:00,952
Is going to for a given, well has path too
so that's just return mark, that's the

270
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:04,911
first part.
And then to actually get the path to a

271
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:08,869
given vertex so, here's the code for doing
that.

272
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:15,516
We actually use a stack to keep track of
the path'cause we get it in reverse order.

273
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,291
If there's no path, we return null.
Otherwise we keep a variable X and we just

274
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:29,212
follow up through the edge to array
Pushing the vertex on to the stack and

275
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:35,121
then moving up the tree in the ray, then
finally push, push as itself on to the

276
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:40,737
path and then we have a stack which is
edible which will give us our path.

277
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:47,302
So that's in time, time proportional to
the length of the path and forth while to

278
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:53,649
check your understanding of how stacks in
real works, irreversible to take a look at

279
00:23:53,649 --> 00:24:00,730
this code to see that it does the job.
So that's depth-first search.

280
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:06,092
Now it's not.
Of the optimal graph searching method for

281
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:10,700
all applications.
And here's an, an amusing representation

282
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,028
of how depth first search can maybe create
problems sometimes.

283
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:19,566
So, I'm getting ready for a date, what
situations do I prepare for?

284
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:23,266
Well, medical emergency, dancing, food too
expensive.

285
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:27,246
Okay, what kind of medical emergencies
could happen?

286
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:32,272
Well, I could be snake bite or a lightning
strike or a fall from a chair.

287
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:37,160
Well, what about snakes, I have to worry
about corn snakes or garder.

288
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,432
Say for copperhead.
And then well, I better make a straight.

289
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:45,985
I better study snakes.
And then the date says, I'm here to pick

290
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,806
you up.
You're not dressed.

291
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:52,149
And well, so I really need to stop using
depth-first search.

292
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,702
So we're gonna look at other graph
searching algorithms.

293
00:24:56,702 --> 00:25:02,936
But if you always try to expand the next
thing that you come to, that's depth-first

294
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,228
search.
And there's a lot of natural, situations

295
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:10,817
where that naturally comes to mind.
Here's another example.

296
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,895
I took this photo of the Taj Mahal a
couple of years ago and I didn't like the

297
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:21,416
color of the sky.
So I used Photoshop's magic wand to make

298
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:25,713
it more blue.
And the implementation, now this is a huge

299
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,972
graph.
This picture's got millions of pixels.

300
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:34,454
And the way that the flood filled the
magic wand works, is to build, from a

301
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:40,231
photo, what's called a grid graph, where
every vertex is a pixel and every edge

302
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:45,639
connects two pixels that are the same
color, approximately the same color.

303
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:51,342
And it builds a blob of all the pixels
that have the same color as the given

304
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,380
pixel.
So when I click on one, it does the

305
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,004
depth-first search to find all.
All the connected pixels and therefore

306
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:06,346
change them to the new color that's a fine
example of depth per search on a huge

307
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:11,696
graph that people use everyday.
So that's our first nontrivial graph

308
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,460
processing algorithm depth-first search.
