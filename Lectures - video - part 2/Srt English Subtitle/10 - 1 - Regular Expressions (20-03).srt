1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,561
Today, we're going to talk about regular
expressions. Now, this is another in the

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:12,088
series of ingenious algorithms that we're
looking at in the second half of this

3
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:16,445
course. Now, this is really one of the
most widely used and one of the coolest

4
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:21,086
algorithms that we're going to cover. to
get started, we have to talk about what is

5
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:26,010
a regular expression. And just putting the
problem in context we've always talked

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,650
about before. in the last lecture, we
talked about the substring search problem,

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,485
which we're just trying to find one string
in a text. Now, we'll talk about a more

8
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:40,468
general problem, a pattern matching
problem, where we find one of a specified

9
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:45,843
set of strings in the decks. So, that's
specified set. rather than talk about one

10
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:50,301
string, we have to describe a set of
strings. And that's what regular

11
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:55,677
expressions are all about. here's an
example from genomics, an actual example

12
00:00:55,677 --> 00:01:00,528
from a real life scientific data
processing. So, there's a thing called

13
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:05,773
Fragile X syndrome, which is a common
cause of mental retardation. the human

14
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:12,810
genome contains is a string that consists
of Cs, Ts, As, and Gs, it's the way we've

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,939
talked about before. and the, they
naturally group themselves into groups of

16
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,613
three. And there's a way to describe a
correlation with the syndrome from a

17
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:31,347
property of the text string or the genome
string. the, the actual scientific data is

18
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:37,807
shown over here on the right, but we'll
just work with the text strings. In the in

19
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:44,714
the English, the description is that
you've got somewhere in your genome

20
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:55,115
repeats of either CGG or AGG, that are
bracketed by GCG at the beginning and CTG

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:01,340
at the end. Now, the number of repeats
inside is very well. So in this case,

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,458
we've got GCJ that's the beginning thing
and then we've got a CGG that's one, AGG

23
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:14,706
that two, CGG that's three. So, we got
three repeats on one of these two patterns

24
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:20,796
and then we have CTG. now, a different
genome might have many more of these

25
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:26,570
triplet patterns inside the number of
repeats is a variable but high, high

26
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,064
repeat is correlated with Fragile X
syndrome. So, clearly medical p

27
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:39,054
rofessionals want to know, given a genome
does it have a high number of repeats with

28
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:45,038
this kind of pattern? then we if so then
we want to look out for this Fragile X

29
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:50,445
syndrome. And the specifying the problem
in English is one thing, but specifying it

30
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:56,298
in a way that is enable to writing a
program to help us find these patterns is

31
00:02:56,298 --> 00:03:01,188
another. and this is the way that we
specify the pattern. Now, this thing is

32
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:06,967
called a regular expression. Let's take
this CGG, and then either a CGG, GCG, and

33
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:13,190
then either a CGG or an AGG any number of
times followed by a CGG. that's specifying

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,340
a set of strings and we might find that if
the text had one of that specified set.

35
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:27,271
here's another example where regular
expressions appear in real life. there's a

36
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:36,076
new source highlight program that we use
to highlight syntax, highlight keywords in

37
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:42,685
our, in our text, and, and also gray out
comments, and so forth. and this is a very

38
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:47,886
general program that works for many
different kinds of languages and outputs

39
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:53,492
to many different print formats. and
that's all about identifying one of a

40
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:58,288
specified set of strings in a text and
doing something with it. It's an

41
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:04,837
application of regular expressions in real
life. in Google, you can search in public

42
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:11,640
search code, it's public source code for
regular expression search so you can

43
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,979
search for code that contains any one of a
specified set of strings. and that's

44
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:26,780
available facility on the web. There's
many, many other applications. Another one

45
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,992
is PROSITE in Biology. there is a bunch of
specified patterns that you can use to

46
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:39,181
search for genome or processing ahm
natural language, it's all about string

47
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:44,847
processing and specifying sets of strings,
programming languages themselves. and the

48
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:50,144
other one we'll look at later on is
validating when you are getting data entry

49
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,497
from the web when you type in a credit
card number, you are told whether it's

50
00:04:55,497 --> 00:05:00,890
legal or not and that's all done with
regular expressions since the string you

51
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:09,945
typed in one of the specified sets. so,
this is very widely used and widely useful

52
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:17,733
application. so we're going to look into
the more general idea that this brings

53
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:24,072
out, is the idea of parsing text files,
and not only finding if the string matches

54
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:30,316
a pattern, but finding if finding the
structure of a string that we can use in

55
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:36,829
some kind of beneficial way. And we'll
come back to it more. so, we're looking at

56
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:43,169
a basic capability that's widely useful,
but it also extends to cover deep issues

57
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:49,104
and processes in Computer Science. So,
what is a regular expression? Well, it's

58
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:55,365
simply a notation to specify a set of
strings. the set could be infinite. we're

59
00:05:55,365 --> 00:06:00,519
going to specify it with a finite pattern
but it, it could be infinite. And we make

60
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,174
a regular expression up just from four
simple operations. first one is called

61
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:11,813
concatenation. so, that's we just take a
bunch of letters and put them, one after

62
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:17,252
the other and a regular expression made
from concatenation matches exactly

63
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:22,623
precisely the sequence of characters that
are specified and it doesn't match

64
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:27,792
anything else. So, that's a simple one by
itself and that's what we use for

65
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:33,706
substring search for example. then there's
or. so that one, we give two different

66
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:39,412
regular expressions and put a vertical bar
between them. And that says we're

67
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:45,257
specifying now a set of size two and we're
happy to match either string in that set.

68
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:51,642
there's no other string that we match. and
then there's one called closure. And this

69
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:58,193
is where an infinite comes in. so, when we
put a star after a character, or a regular

70
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:03,345
expression, as we'll see, that's
specifying zero or more occurrences of

71
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:09,131
that character. So, AA matches AB<i>A
because that's zero occurrences of B in</i>

72
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:16,154
between. Or A with eight Bs followed by an
A matches, because that's got zero or more

73
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:22,399
Bs in between two As. but if you don't
have an A at the beginning and the end, or

74
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,961
if you don't have all Bs inside, that
doesn't match. And that's an infinite

75
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:33,673
number of strings, zero on any number of
occurrences of B. So, with just four

76
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:39,911
characters were specifying an infinite set
of strings. and then, the next operation

77
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:45,542
to allow us to build regular expressions
of arbitrary complexity is si mply

78
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:52,069
parentheses. if you include regular
expressions within a parentheses, then you

79
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,778
can apply the star operator or
concatenation to a, another regular

80
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:04,577
expression. So, these are examples of
regular expressions using parentheses. So,

81
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:09,505
this says, A and then what's inside the
parentheses, which is the regular

82
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:14,499
expression that says either A or B and
then followed by AAB. So, that matches

83
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:19,558
precisely these two strings. either A
followed by an A followed by AB or A

84
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:24,968
followed by B followed by AAA and it
doesn't match anything else. or if you put

85
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:30,193
a more complicated regular expression
inside parenthesis with a star, it still

86
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:35,982
means zero or more occurrences. So, just A
would be zero occurrences. and then, this

87
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:41,516
is one, two, three, four occurrences of AB
followed by A. And again, if it's not of

88
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:47,681
that form, it doesn't match. this one
doesn't have AB, and, and neither does

89
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:53,355
this, it has one AB, but then the next one
would have to be either AB or A. There's

90
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:59,170
been a way to get one of these strings by
including zero more occurrences of AB.

91
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:04,678
these things here are, are precedence
order when we're performing the

92
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:10,430
operations. so the first thing is
parenthesis, next thing is a star, next

93
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:17,073
thing is concatenation and finally the or
operation. In this table then completely

94
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:23,150
specifies what we mean by regular
expression. It's a sequence of characters.

95
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:29,062
alphabet characters like A and B and
metacharacters, like or and star and

96
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:35,393
parenthesis that we use to describe a
possibly infinite set of strings. Now in

97
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:41,743
the real world it's often worthwhile and,
and useful to add some additional

98
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:48,252
operations for convenience. for example,
the wild card operation needs to have a

99
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:57,612
dot and another metacharacter that matches
any letter at all. and that's shorthand

100
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:04,422
for listing all the letters separated by
or and then but that's a lot of characters

101
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:10,516
and so, with one character, we can match
the same regular expression. and so this

102
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:16,402
one you can use like to solve a crossword
puzzle, for example. this one matches all

103
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:22,218
the words that will have alternating U
with all the seven letter words that have

104
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:28,090
alternating Us. and so there's a couple.
but there's some other ones tha sort of

105
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,561
have alternating use, but not quite. And
they don't match, so it's a wild card

106
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:39,942
character. and then, there's classes of
character, so capital A-Z means any

107
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:46,121
capital letter. and then a-z means any
lower case letter. so any capitalized

108
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:52,629
letter, any lower case letter followed by
any number of lower case letters will

109
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:59,137
match something like this but it won't
match something like that, just classes of

110
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:05,892
characters. And again, this is shorthand
for typing all the characters and using or

111
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,155
at least one. So, rather than star, which
says, zero or more occurrences, plus means

112
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:18,743
one or more occurrences. so that's another
example of a convenient shorthand or

113
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:25,395
exactly K putting in braces that I want to
specify, this specifies I want exactly

114
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:31,300
five digits, followed by a dash, followed
by exactly four digits. So, that's a way

115
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,209
to specify, you know, something like a
legal plus for zip code. and it doesn't

116
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:43,580
match other things. now in, in practice,
in, in, in terms of practical clients

117
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:50,101
these types of shorthands are extremely
important in terms of the theory and the

118
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:56,622
idea of processing regular expressions
since we can specify them all with the

119
00:11:56,622 --> 00:12:02,851
basic operations we'll pretty much ignore
them in our code. so, in every, in every

120
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:09,111
case we could write [A-E] + if we wanted
we could write this longhand of it, but of

121
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:13,855
course users are going to write the
shorthand. but still, if we have a

122
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:19,390
mechanism for dealing with this, then we
can certainly take care of the shorthand.

123
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:26,185
so, just with those basic operations and,
and also the shorthand is helpful and our

124
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:33,685
notation is amazingly expressive. There's
really a lot you can do with it. so, for

125
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:40,493
example, you can do substring search with
a regular expression. one way to express

126
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:45,839
the substring search problem is to put
your string preceded by dot star and put a

127
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,315
dot star at the end, you know, and that's
asking if your string is in the infinite

128
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:55,164
language described by this regular
expression, is equivalent to the substring

129
00:12:55,164 --> 00:13:00,448
search problem. It matches if and only, if
that string is in there so, for example,

130
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:05,664
in these two and not in that two so
notation covers the substring search

131
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:11,580
problem. But then also, it can specify
easily useful sets of strings that, that,

132
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,221
you know, that we often want to check. So
this is similar to the zip plus four, the

133
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:22,311
three digits followed by a dash followed
by two digits, followed by a dash,

134
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:28,159
followed by four digits. that's a good
start towards knowing whether the string

135
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,472
is a legal Social Security Number or not.
Or is it a legal e-mail address or not.

136
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:40,142
this is a simplified version but it
basically says, you ought to have at least

137
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:46,028
one letter followed by an @, followed by
some letters, followed by a dot, followed

138
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:51,985
by edu or com or of course to cover all
e-mail addresses, you need to consider

139
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:58,157
some more possibilities. but this is a, a
quick and succinct way to specify a set of

140
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:05,226
string or Java identifier, what's a legal
Java identifier. so, this is one way to

141
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:11,149
specify legal Java identifier. And indeed,
programming languages like Java use

142
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:17,380
regular expressions like this to define
what they mean by a legal identifier, and

143
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,841
then, the kinds of processes that we're
going to talk about to actually check that

144
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:29,610
what you typed is legal and echoes all the
way up to the program itself. the, you

145
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,082
know, is, is this a legal Java program?
It's almost but not quite, as we'll see in

146
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:39,814
regular expression pattern matching
problem. Very, very expressive in a

147
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:46,131
widely-used language. Now, what's, what's
really interesting about this topic and

148
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:51,978
we'll just I, I touch on it, even though
it's extremely important to what we're

149
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:57,671
going to do is that just from the
standpoint of the theory of computation

150
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:03,365
starting with the, the time of Turing and
others in the 30s', our regular

151
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:09,841
expressions play an important role in our
understanding of the theory of computation

152
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:16,531
and that understanding actually has led to
that algorithm that we're going to talk

153
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:23,459
about. That's a very interesting aspect of
this. but still, even given that you know,

154
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,870
regular expressions are just useful in
everyday life. this is an example of

155
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:37,542
someone that used the regular expression
to screen a job candidate. and, and this

156
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:44,848
is actually illegal to look for words like
Enron, or Kerry, or Bush or Gore or

157
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:52,771
Republican. to decide whether a, a, a job
candidate's job application will get

158
00:15:52,771 --> 00:16:00,165
through. This one uses an exclamation
point, which mean just end with anything.

159
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:10,427
it's like dot star. so someone, a typical
computer user can learn to regular

160
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:20,517
expressions to with great effect. even
Google supports, a regular Google search

161
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:29,287
window supports a star as a full word wild
card and or for union. Although not full

162
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:36,254
regular expression pattern matching.
although that day is surely coming. so

163
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:42,756
people who just get into it just a little
bit and start to see the utility of

164
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:49,412
regular expressions certainly get excited
about it. And you can find examples of

165
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:56,301
this all through the web. this is an X,
XKCD comic about it where there's a

166
00:16:56,301 --> 00:17:02,106
problem, you know, how can we search
through 200 megabytes of emails looking

167
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:08,143
for something formated like an address.
And lawyers want to do this all the time

168
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:13,737
nowadays, and it's hopeless. But now, I
know regular expressions. and the regular

169
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:19,945
expression super being swoops to the
rescue and types a regular expression in

170
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:25,463
Perl, which is a, a widely-used language
that's based on regular expressions that

171
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:31,119
we'll talk about briefly in a minute and
swoops away. So, there is somewhat of a

172
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,913
feeling what people don't know just a
little bit that regular expressions can be

173
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:42,006
used to solve any problem. that's not
quite true as we know from the theory of

174
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:46,894
computation and we'll also touch on that a
little bit. so the, the question is, can

175
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:51,905
the average programmer learn to use
regular expressions effectively? And

176
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:56,982
there's all kinds of evidence out there
that lots of programmers use, use in

177
00:17:57,182 --> 00:18:02,995
extensively. But not to pour cold water on
it but we have to take everything with

178
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:08,540
some restraint. And here's an example of a
regular expression that you can find out

179
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,485
on the web. it's written in Perl, but it's
a regular expression to check whether an

180
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:20,882
-email address is va lid or not. now, that
is quite a regular expression. and one

181
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:26,342
might argue whether that's really an
effective way to use regular expressions.

182
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:32,340
Maybe there's a simpler and easier way to
check for valid e-mail, e-mail addresses.

183
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:38,272
but anyway, this one is out there and is
used probably being used efficiently

184
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:43,835
somewhere to the end, effectively
somewhere today. but, but really for

185
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:49,492
people who are educated in, in Computer
Science, need to know that regular

186
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:55,894
expressions are definitely powerful tools,
but writing in regular expression really

187
00:18:55,894 --> 00:19:00,613
is like writing a program. you have, you
have to understand the underlying

188
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:06,115
programming model. It's so often even more
so than many programming languages since

189
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:11,550
there's so few rules, it's easier to write
a regular expression than it is to read

190
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:17,223
one. And if it's difficult to read, it
means it's difficult to debug. and so, you

191
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:23,353
can find a lot of flaming on the web about
this. and this is a particular apt,

192
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:29,188
particularly apt quote. Some people, when
confronted with a problem I think I know,

193
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:34,893
I'll use regular expressions. Now, they
have two problems. And I think that's a

194
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:40,609
good way to summarize the bottom line.
That regular expressions are amazingly

195
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:45,806
powerful and expressive. But you can, they
can get very complex in real in real

196
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:51,225
applications. still, there's plenty of
real applications where they can be

197
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:56,941
succinct and effective. And so, we're
going to look next at regular expression

198
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,020
pattern matching algorithms.
