1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,733
To get started, we're going to introduce
the idea of search problem which

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:16,306
encompasses many of the fundamental
problems that we want to try to solve. so

3
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:22,022
here's a familiar problem from secondary
school, we'll call it LSOLVE. So, the

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:27,630
problem is, given system of linear
equations find a solution. so, we've got

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,313
simultaneous equations involving the
variables x1, x0, x1, and x2, and what we

6
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:40,419
need to do is find a solution. In this
case, these three equations have the

7
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:45,449
solution x0 = -one, x1 = two, and x2 =
two.

8
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:51,640
If you plug those values in for x0, x1,
and x2 and those equations, they, you'll

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,473
find that they satisfy those equations.
in, in secondary school you learn how to

10
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:03,969
solve those with Gaussian elimination or
eliminate a variable at a time. so that's

11
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:10,392
LSOLVE. now, last time we talked about
linear program, programming. and that's a

12
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:16,520
similar problem that you can almost cast
as the following given a system of linear

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,753
inequalities, you know, find a solution.
Actually for LP we do a little bit more

14
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:27,994
because we also try to optimize. But, this
is a fine characterization of a way to

15
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:33,862
formulate the problem. So now, we just
have inequalities. and again, there's a

16
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:39,361
solution. actually, the first part of the
computational burden in linear programming

17
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,732
is to know whether there's a solution or
not before you can even apply the simplest

18
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:51,152
method. so we in this case, there is some
equations on the left, and on the right

19
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:57,202
there's values that if you plug those
values into those equations, they satisfy

20
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:03,098
it. So, that's minor inequalities of
satisfiability. here's another one.

21
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:09,378
suppose that again we have inequalities
but suppose that we insist that the

22
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:14,968
variables be zero or one. and actually,
this is a special case of linear

23
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:21,373
programing that comes up to be useful as a
model in many situations where the

24
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:27,390
variables modeled as I say, what's going
on in an electronic circuit or maybe other

25
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:32,341
situations where we just did want, want
them to be zero or one. And we had an

26
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:37,856
example of this when we were talking about
bipartite matching reduction to linear

27
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:43,520
program, programming. so that's in this
case, you take those equations, those

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,960
inequalities and you put in those values.
And sure enough, x1 + x2 is bigger than

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,050
one, x0 + x2 is bigger to the one but the,
the some of the three of them it's less

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,376
than or equal to two, so that's a
solution. and this is just one more so

31
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:05,605
those are all called satisfiability
problems. So, you have a bunch of

32
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:10,518
equations, with variables. And you have
values for the variables. And you want to

33
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:15,555
know if the variables satisfy the
equation. and the simplest satisfiability

34
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:20,779
problem is the one that just uses Boolean
values. given a system of Boolean

35
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:26,234
equations where the variables are either
true or false, and then the equations are

36
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:31,999
just made up of or an and connective in
the presentation. And, and you, you're

37
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:38,849
checking whether in a bunch of when an
expression involving truth values is true

38
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:47,392
or false in the prime means not. So, not
x1 or x2 and x0 or x2 equals true. that's

39
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:56,217
going to be true in that case. that's
going to be satisfied in that case because

40
00:03:56,217 --> 00:04:04,304
x1 equals false, so not s1 is true. So the
first term is true here. not x1 is true so

41
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:09,426
that, or whatever is true. and then this
term here, x0 or x2, x2 is true. So, both

42
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:14,163
those terms are true and we're adding
them, so it's true. And you should go

43
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:19,605
through and check each of the equations to
make sure that those truth values satisfy

44
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:24,391
those equations. So, those are fundamental
problems. They're very similar in nature.

45
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:29,251
and there's lots and lots of applications
where people want to find efficient

46
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:33,792
solutions for these problems. so the
question is, how do these things fit into

47
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:38,451
our theory? Which of these have algorithms
that are guaranteed to run in polynomial

48
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:42,548
time? When you look at the problems, they
didn't look really all that much

49
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:47,594
different. well, for LSOLVE, we have
Gaussian elimination and other ways to

50
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:53,350
solve Gaussian elimination works in n
cubed time or end of three halves time

51
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,771
where n's the size of the input. but what
about the other ones? do they have

52
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:04,594
polynomial time algorithms? well, LP I
mentioned briefly at the end of the last

53
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:09,279
lecture. yeah. It was proven but actually
was open for decades. It wasn't until

54
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:17,660
solved where we knew that there existed a
guaranteed polynomial time algorithm for

55
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,613
linear programming. And then it was
decades later before those algorithms were

56
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:27,749
brought to the point where they could
compete with simplex in practice. but it

57
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:32,682
happened. that was a problem, we didn't
know whether there was a polynomial time

58
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:37,725
algorithm for many, many years even though
people were trying to find it. but with

59
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:42,588
articulating this division in the theory
helped with the idea of let's get, let's

60
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:49,725
find a polynomial time algorithm and
someone did. and so, that's was certainly

61
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:55,484
difficult to bring that about, but it
happened. And then, you might say, well

62
00:05:55,484 --> 00:06:00,720
that gives some hope that we could do
others. But actually for integer linear

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,820
programming, you just take linear
programming and restrict the variables to

64
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,989
have zero or one values, or Boolean
satisfiability. nobody knows a polynomial

65
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:16,361
time algorithm. And, in fact, few people
believe that a polynomial time algorithm,

66
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:21,529
guaranteed polynomial time algorithm
exists for these problems. But, we still

67
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:28,710
don't know for sure. that's the topic of
today's lecture. Now, all of these things

68
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:35,157
are examples of search problems. and we
characterize them this way cuz it's an

69
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:41,388
intuitive way to describe really the
problems that we want to solve. so the

70
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:48,279
idea is that the problem has, lots of
problem instances, its input. and what you

71
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:54,994
want to do in a search problem is find a
solution, or report that there's no

72
00:06:54,994 --> 00:07:00,825
solution. so, there's just one
requirement. And the requirement that

73
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:06,480
distinguish, distinguishes a search
problem from just any problem is that we

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,194
have to be able to efficiently check that
the given solution is in fact the

75
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:18,519
solution. Say, in that efficiently in this
lecture means in poly, guaranteed

76
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,300
polynomial time in the size of the input.
And for the problems that I just gave

77
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:31,204
they're definitely search problems.
because just take a look at what they are.

78
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:37,325
So, for LSOLVE, the problem is input
instances are just systems of linear

79
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:43,855
equations. So, matrix of N squared
numbers, N  N + one numbers. And solution

80
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:49,900
is just three numbers. And to check the
solution, just plug in the values to

81
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,511
verify each equation so that's certainly
polynomial time in the size of the input.

82
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:02,395
So, LSOLVE is a search problem. And
similarly, LP is a search problem. LP

83
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:09,401
characterized in this way. you've got a
system of linear inequalities and you're

84
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:15,220
given a solution, you can efficiently
check that, that solution satisfy those

85
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,512
inequalities. These satisfiability
problems are all search problems. In

86
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:24,540
interlinear programming, you have the
inequalities. you get values that are zero

87
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,445
or one. You can plug them in the equations
and check. That's what characterizes a

88
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:34,595
search problem. It's got a small solution
that we can efficiently check whether it's

89
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:41,557
a solution and satisfy the same. You've
got the truth values, you've got the

90
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:48,050
equations and then you plug in values and
verify each equation. now, what we're

91
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,588
doing is distinguishing search problems
from other kinds of problems that are very

92
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:58,658
similar. And actually, the theory works
for these other kinds of problems. One

93
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:03,862
kind is called a decision problem where
it's just problems that have a yes, no

94
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:09,709
answer. in, another one is optimization
problems which are problems of where you

95
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:15,571
want to find the best solution in some
sense like linear probic, programming or

96
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:21,709
shortest path. but the theory that we're
about to lay out all the major conclusions

97
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:27,709
hold for any one of these classes of
problems. it's just that it's best to fix

98
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:34,261
on one to make sure that there's no holes
in any of the statements that we make. so

99
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:39,563
we're doing that at the outset with the
search problem. Now, and, and, and so you

100
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:47,032
can imagine so if one way to check that if
you have a problem that finds a solution

101
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:52,925
to a linear programming problem, you can
specify it in such a way that it's a

102
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:59,366
decision block. Is there a solution that
satisfies another given inequality linear,

103
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:05,121
combination of the value's less than a
certain value? And then you can use binary

104
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:10,877
search or something to do the, the final m
aximiza, minimization for linear program,

105
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:15,700
programming, and so forth. There's all
kinds of way to move among these problems.

106
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,530
But we're going to focus on search
problems. so here's another one factor. so

107
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,579
given an inv, integer, find a nontrivial
factor,. might find, it might take a lot

108
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:33,780
of computation to try to find a factor.
but if somebody gives you a factor, then

109
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,754
all you have to do is long divide. So
again, factor is a search problem. so

110
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:46,106
those are some examples of the basic types
of problems that we're foing to consider

111
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,980
when we investigate intractability.
