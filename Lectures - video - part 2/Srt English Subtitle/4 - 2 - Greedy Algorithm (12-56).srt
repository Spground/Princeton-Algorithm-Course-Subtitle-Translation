1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,156
To introduce the algorithms for minimum
spanning tree, we're going tp look at a

2
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:10,853
general algorithm called a greedy
algorithm.

3
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:15,816
It's a good example of a general principle
in algorithm design that will help us,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,473
prove correctness of our algorithms.
To begin we'll make some simplifying

5
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:23,966
assumptions.
First we assume that the edge weights are

6
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,907
all distinct, and that the graph is
connected.

7
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,910
And this is just to simplify the
presentation.

8
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:35,383
As a consequence of these two exhumptions
we know that the minimum spanning tree

9
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:39,814
exists and is unique.
Our algorithms will still work when edge

10
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:44,115
winks are not distinct.
And if the graph is not connected, it'll

11
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:49,262
find spanning trees or components.
But these two assumptions simplify the

12
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:53,410
presentation.
Now, to understand our algorithms we're

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,470
going to start with a general operation on
graph called making a cut.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,470
So a cut in a graph is a partition of its
vertices into two non-empty sets,

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,602
And we'll indicate that just by coloring
some of the vertices grey and others

16
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,761
white.
So that's a partition of the two sets: the

17
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:16,630
grey vertices and the white vertices.
Every vertex is either grey or white,

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,498
And there's at least one in each set.
Now, given a cut, the crossing edge

19
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:26,894
connects a vertex in one set with a vertex
in the other. So every edge that connects

20
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:30,250
a grey vertex to a white vertex is a
crossing edge.

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,377
So that's, a second definition.
That gives us a way to talk about, inches

22
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,100
and graphs when we compete them into a
spanning tree.

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:47,017
So an important property that is relevant
to MST algorithms is that, given any cut

24
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:50,750
at all,
The cut defines a set of crossing edges.

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,910
The minimum weight crossing edge is in the
MST. Remember no two edges have the same

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:03,141
weight so there's a single edge that has
minimum weight from the edges in the edges

27
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:07,152
in the cut.
So in this case the thick red edge is the

28
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:12,739
minimum weight, it's the shortest edge
connecting a grey vertex to the white one

29
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:17,500
and that, that edge has to be in the MST.
That's the cut property.

30
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:21,600
So here's a, just a quick proof of that
property.

31
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:26,460
I'll hand wave a bit through the
discussions of the proof.

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,043
It's a.
Usually not appropriate to fully dimension

33
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:34,509
proofs in the lectures.
So you should look at the book and the

34
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:39,960
underlined materials to be sure that you
understand the proofs or, or re-read these

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,112
slides.
But I'll try to give all the steps.

36
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:46,068
So, we're trying to prove the cut
property.

37
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:49,548
Giving any cut the crossing edge in many
ways to MST.

38
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:55,328
So let's suppose the contradiction.
So suppose that we have a minimum-weight

39
00:02:55,328 --> 00:03:01,641
crossing edge that's not in the MST.
So, in this case, that edge E, suppose

40
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:07,446
it's not in the MST.
So it means that some, one of the other

41
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:14,323
crossing edges has to be in the MST.
Otherwise the MST wouldn't be connected.

42
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:18,762
Then if you add E to the MST you get a
cycle.

43
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:23,986
And some other edge in that cycle has to
be a crossing edge.

44
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:30,366
That's the way to think about it.
Remember MST is a minimal way to connect

45
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:34,721
the graph.
And if you add an edge to a, a tree you

46
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:39,234
get a cycle.
And then some other edge that has to be a

47
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:43,975
crossing edge.
But if you remove that edge and add e then

48
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:49,830
you're going to get a spanning tree.
And that spanning tree is smaller than the

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,068
one that you had.
So, that, supposition had to be a

50
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:58,691
contradiction.
So, it has to be that the minimum weight

51
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:03,160
crossing edge is in the MST.
So that's the, cut property.

52
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:10,712
So, and now given that property, we can
develop what's called a greedy algorithm,

53
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:15,510
Which is the easiest algorithm, we can
come up with.

54
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:21,374
So what we're going to do is start with,
all edges colored grey.

55
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,902
Find any cut that has no black crossing
edges.

56
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:28,329
The algorithm's going to color some of the
edges black.

57
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:33,931
And color the minimum-weight edge of that
cut black, and just repeat the algorithm.

58
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:38,875
Finding any cut with no black crossing
edges, color the minimum-weight edge

59
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:43,752
black, and keep going until you have v
minus one edges that are colored back.

60
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:47,047
And the claim is that that's going to
compute an MST.

61
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:52,583
Let's look at a demo of that, just to make
sure that we follow what's going on.

62
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:58,185
So we start with all edges colored gray.
We're supposed to find a cut with no black

63
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,216
crossing edges and colors minimum weight
edge black.

64
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:05,987
Well, that could be any cut.
In this case, we'll take the cut that, has

65
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:11,209
three, two, and six on one side and, one,
zero, zero, one, four, five, seven on the

66
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,917
other side.
Look at all the crossing edges.

67
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,527
Minimum white crossing edge is the one
from zero to two, so the, that's the one

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,473
that we'll color black.
So now we have zero, two and the MST is

69
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:26,758
color black.
So again, any cut that doesn't have a

70
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:31,748
black crossing edge, so in this case,
let's do the cut that just has five on one

71
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,738
side and all the odds on the other side.
In this case, there's three crossing

72
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,960
edges, the smallest one is five, seven,
color that one black.

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,090
Again, any cut that has no black crossing
edges.

74
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,818
So let's just take six the cut that has
six on one side and all the others and the

75
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:52,082
other.
Two, six is the minimum crossing edge so

76
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:54,880
six, two.
And so we put that one on the MST.

77
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,900
As we get more and more black edges it's
going to be harder to find a cut with no

78
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,349
black crossing edges.
But we press on.

79
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,431
So now let's do the cut with zero, two,
four, and six on one side colored white.

80
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,064
And one, three, five, and seven on the
others.

81
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,942
So there's a lot of crossing edges that
cut.

82
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:17,901
But the smallest one is the one between
zero and seven, so that's the one that we

83
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,827
color black and add to the MST.
So now we have four edges, and our next

84
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:27,728
cut now one and three on one side.
A smallest edge in that, right, the

85
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:31,479
smallest crossing edge for that cut is
two, three.

86
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:38,041
Now one more, now let's put one and four,
now almost all the edges left are crossing

87
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,927
edges.
So one and four are one side, all the rest

88
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:46,498
are in the other.
And, the minimum weight crossing edge is

89
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:51,318
the one from one to seven.
Now notice, in this case, we got the nodes

90
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:56,996
in the tree on one side of the kit, cut.
And the nodes not in the tree on the other

91
00:06:56,996 --> 00:07:01,012
side of the cut.
One of our algorithms will always have

92
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:03,783
that property.
So now, we add one to seven.

93
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:07,729
Seven in seven to that,
And now the last thing, is to.

94
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:13,615
The only cut that, has no black edges is
the one that puts four on one side, and

95
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:18,254
all the rest on the other.
And the minimum way of crossing edge for

96
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:24,593
that one is, five, four.
So now, we've got. eight vertices,

97
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:31,192
And seven vertices in the seven edges in
the MST. so we found the MST.

98
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:37,000
We've got V minus one edge is color black
and we found the MST.

99
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,016
So the greedy algorithm was a very general
algorithm.

100
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:46,316
We're allow to find any cut at all that
has no black cras crossing edges.

101
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:51,079
So let's do the correctness proof.
And then we'll look at some specific

102
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,300
instances of the greedy algorithm.
So.

103
00:07:54,581 --> 00:08:02,471
First of all since we took the minimum
crossing edge of a cut always to color

104
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:08,295
black any black edge is in the MST.
That's the cut property.

105
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:15,246
Do a cut no black crossing edges you can
color black, that's in the MST.

106
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:20,600
So that's first observation.
Now when we have.

107
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,478
Fewer than v minus one black edges.
There has to be a cut that has no black

108
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,623
crossing edges.
That is the algorithm doesn't get stuck.

109
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:37,556
And so the way to think about that is just
take the verticies in one of the connected

110
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:42,941
components, and make that the cut.
Then there's gonna be, since that's a

111
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:49,219
connected component there's gonna be no
black edges in the crossing edges for, for

112
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:52,158
that cut.
So the algorithm doesn't get stuck.

113
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:57,234
If the, if you don't have an MST yet,
there's going to be some cut with no black

114
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,171
crossing edges.
And that's it.

115
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:04,738
The greedy algorithm computes the MST.
Any edge colored black is in the MST,

116
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,133
And you can always add to the set of black
edges.

117
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:14,002
Now if you don't have v minus one once you
have v minus one you've got v minus one

118
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:20,014
edges that are in the MST. The MST has v
minus one edges greedy algorithm computes

119
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:22,347
mst.
So now what we want to do is

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,217
implementations of the greedy algorithm
or, or specializations of it really that

121
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:32,390
differ first of all in the way that they
choose the cut.

122
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:37,457
Which cut are we going to use?
And also, the way in which they find the

123
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:42,963
minimum weight edge in the cut.
Again, those could both be, expensive

124
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:46,763
operations.
And prohibitively, prohibitively expense,

125
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:51,532
expensive for huge graphs.
What we're going to look at is, two

126
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:56,897
classic implementations called Kruskal's
Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm.

127
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,081
Although, in both cases, we use modern
data structures to make them efficient for

128
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:07,328
huge graphs.
And there's another interesting algorithm

129
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:12,544
called Boruvka's Algorithm, that, that
kind of combines the two briefly

130
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:17,857
mentioned.
Now before getting to those, what about

131
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:26,136
removing the two simplifying assumptions?
So what happens if you have, a situation

132
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:30,323
where the edge weights are not all
distinct?

133
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:36,731
So in this, case, 1-2 and 2-4.
Both have the same edge weight.

134
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:44,117
Well so also do one three and three four.
And so it means there's multiple MSTs.

135
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:48,818
So in this case the, there's two different
MSTs.

136
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,384
So the greedy algorithm is still correct,
it turns out, our correctness proof

137
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:58,859
doesn't quite work, but that can be fixed
with a little bit of work.

138
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:03,963
So the fact is it's still correct.
And if the graph is not connected, as I

139
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:09,697
mentioned, then what we'll get is what's
called a minimum spanning forest, which is

140
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:14,032
the MST of each component.
Essentially it's like independently

141
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:18,480
computing the MSTs of the components.
But.

142
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,993
Basically what the greedy algorithm gives
us is an easy way to prove correctness for

143
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:30,575
specific algorithms.
All we have to show is that they're

144
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:36,011
finding a cut and taking a minimum weight
edge from that cut.

145
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:41,370
And then we can prove correctness of a
more complicated algorithm.

146
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:47,060
In general, in algorithm design this is
proven to be affective in all kinds of

147
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,718
domains.
Trying to come up with a general algorithm

148
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:56,611
that you can prove works efficiently and
then using that to help design specific

149
00:11:56,611 --> 00:12:00,674
ones.
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that

150
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:05,927
greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
Greed is right.

151
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:11,084
Greed works.
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures

152
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:17,388
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
Greed in all of it's forms.

153
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:24,551
Greed for life, for money, for love,
knowledge, has marked the upward surge of

154
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,848
mankind.
And greed, you mark my words, will not

155
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:39,871
only save Teldar Paper,
But that other malfunctioning corporation

156
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:45,349
called the USA.
Thank you very much.

157
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,949
.
Great, great.

158
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,080
Fly me to the moon, and let me play among
the stars. .
