1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,108
Okay, so next we'll look at what the idea
of the classes P and NP mean in terms of

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,608
actual problems we're looking at solving.
we want to classify our problems the same

3
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:22,966
way as which scientists classify elements.
And the key technique they're going to,

4
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:29,406
that we're gonna use is reduction. So the
problem that we're gonna start with. That

5
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:35,709
is, the key to this theory is the Boolean
satisfiability problem. and we talked

6
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:42,612
about at the beginning, it's not that
different than Gaussian than systems

7
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:47,939
linear equations. It's just that
everything has to be Boolean variables.

8
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:55,228
and so. given a system of boolean
equations, find a solution. and. Even on

9
00:00:55,228 --> 00:01:02,952
it's own, it's a very significant problem.
it Has come, it comes up, and, and people

10
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:08,644
solve huge and, and face huge
satisfiability problems in trying to

11
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:15,095
understand whether trying to prove whether
software, to verify software, that

12
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:22,380
software works correctly. Also, hardware
for design automation. people model what's

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,286
going on with huge satisfiability problems
and solve them. it's, it's so basic that

14
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:35,350
it even arises in, in, in physics, and
scientific studies, and. The so-called,

15
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:42,373
mean field diluted spin class model. It's
a very fundamental, problem that is just,

16
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:50,882
about, logical reasoning about what's
going on, in, in some complex system. now

17
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:57,728
the question is, so it's a search problem.
we know that and what that means is that

18
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:06,049
if we have a solution, we can efficiently
check that we have a solution But the

19
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,783
question is, is it in P? Can we find an
algorithm that guarantees to find a

20
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:17,982
solution in polynomial time? Now people
solve huge problems be, but in some sense

21
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:24,414
maybe they're lucky because the instances
that they're trying to solve don't cause

22
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:30,768
the algorithm to run in polynomial time.
But the real question is can we guarantee

23
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:39,509
that we'll get that in polynomial time?
So, well. What do we do? Well. For satisfy

24
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,700
ability, as I mentioned, it's pretty easy
to use. Exhaustive search, just try all

25
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,019
the truth assignments. and really what
that means is, they have an algorithm that

26
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,146
if doesn't find the right tru th
assignment it might wind up trying all of

27
00:02:55,146 --> 00:03:00,657
them. but you might find on earlier and
that's, that's what happens with practice.

28
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:05,784
but the big question is, can we do
anything that is really substantially more

29
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:10,867
clever than sat? then, then the brute
force algorithm. that, that is an

30
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:16,113
algorithm run brute force in the, in the
worst, worst case. That's a, that's a

31
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:21,220
pretty stringent definition of
substantially. but that's the one that

32
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,886
we're that we're talking about. can we get
less than exponential, worst case

33
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:32,553
performance. And some people have worked
on this for long enough now to, that most

34
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:37,903
people agree that there's no polynomial
time algorithm for SAT. To start

35
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:44,914
classifying problems, what we're going to
do is kind of adopt that as an assumption.

36
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:51,192
Or at least we'll classify problems
according to the difficulty of, of SAT.

37
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:58,040
And what that means is we're going to use
reduction from SAT. So if we reduce SAT to

38
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,087
some problem. as we talked about in the
reduction layer, lecture. That means if we

39
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:09,417
could solve this problem efficiently, we
also could solve that efficiently. And

40
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:14,684
we're going to, call, a problem like that
intractable. if we could solve it

41
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:18,543
efficiently we could solve SAD
efficiently. We don't think we can solve

42
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:22,782
SAD efficiently. that problem's
intractable. So that's, that's our meaning

43
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:27,889
of the word intractable. Alright, so now
what are we gonna do to classify problems?

44
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:32,551
So, the first thing is which search
problems in, in P, so there's no really

45
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:38,553
easy answer for that except for, devising
algorithms. but we do have this reduction

46
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:44,428
technique that is gonna help us It's, now
we can be a little more general than when

47
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:49,855
we were actually designing algorithms that
we we're gonna use and we can have the

48
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:55,539
reduction take polynomial amount of time
before we're insisting on linear time. And

49
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:02,902
not only that, we can. Take a polynomial
number of calls to the, the one that we're

50
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:08,761
reducing to. And again all this is about
is that if you have a polynomial time

51
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:14,551
algorithm for y then the reduction gives
you a polynomial time algorithm for x. And

52
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:19,922
we're just try ing to have the most
general definition that preserves that

53
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:26,404
property. and so the consequences that if
we have a polynomial time reduction from

54
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:32,643
SAT to a given problem Y, then we can
conclude that Y is well, it's intractable.

55
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:38,882
By our definition. that is it's as
difficult as SAT and we think that there

56
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:45,121
is no polynomial time algorithm for it. So
that's a mean tool that we're going to

57
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:51,130
start out with to use for classifying
problems so let's look at an example.

58
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,577
Actually you can work with simpler
versions of, of SAT. You can actually

59
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:04,339
reduce any SAT problem to just a form
where you have a bunch of equations using

60
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:12,596
literals . so, usually we use and so for
example like that. So, given that fact to

61
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:19,043
find a solution. so, now we have another
problem IOP given a system of linear

62
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:29,689
inequalities find a solution. So, what we
want to do is, Characterize sat as an ILP

63
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,743
problem. So, that is, if we had an
efficient solution to ILP, it'd give us a

64
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:44,831
solution to sat. So let's take a look at,
this example. so our, whatever SAT problem

65
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:52,662
we have, we put it in this form. and now,
we're gonna introduce a variable, C1. and,

66
00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:00,770
for every, literal in the SAT problem.
we're gonna, put C1 greater than or = to,

67
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:08,786
either the literal, if it's not negated.
Or one minus the literal if it is negated.

68
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:16,053
so in this case, . And so we have C1
greater or = to one - x1. Greater than x

69
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:22,567
or greater than x3, like that. and then
we're going to have a fourth inequality.

70
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:30,045
that says that it has to be less than or
equal to the sum of those three. so what

71
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:36,559
this construction does is if the equation
is satisfied, if there's some way to

72
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:45,388
satisfy this equation then it's going to
be C1 equals to one. so that is, if there

73
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:56,193
is a way to, make each one of these terms
one, say by setting X1 to zero, X2 to one

74
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:06,870
and X3 to one, then this thing will be,
those things all will be true. and then

75
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,747
this one also will be true. And all four
of these are true. If and only if, the

76
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:18,077
equation is satisfied. And we make a
little group like that for, all four of

77
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:24,911
the equations. and then we do a, a similar
thing wi th a variable that's true if and

78
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:30,515
only if, all of the c's are true. So this
one's, this variable has got to be less

79
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:36,256
than all four of these. And the only way
that this thing's gonna be one, is if all

80
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:41,661
the equations are satisfied. So this
system, has a solution. if and only if,

81
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:47,070
there's a SAT solution. And from the
solution to the system, you can find the

82
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,137
SAT solution. So that's a reduction from
SAT to integer linear programming,

83
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:57,820
programming. Because of this reduction, we
feel that we don't, we're not gonna have a

84
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,434
polynomial time solution to integer linear
programming. If we did, we'd have a fast

85
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:08,208
solution to SAT. so that's, that's an
important, piece of knowledge where you

86
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,483
focus on this one hard problem that we
know about, and that tells us another

87
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,919
problem, is that, the, the reduction tells
us another problem that is at least as

88
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:24,712
hard. and that by itself is interesting
integer linear programming is a very

89
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:32,946
important computation with lots of
applications. but the a, amazing thing

90
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:42,604
that was shown by Dick Carp in the 70s, is
that there are lots and lots of problems

91
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:51,013
that you can reduce satisfiability to. and
actually you. Car produced SAT to the so

92
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:56,723
called independent set problem then reduce
that one to aisle P, but if you do two

93
00:09:56,723 --> 00:10:02,644
reductions it still, it still works. if, I
could solve ILP quickly. I could solve

94
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:08,566
independent set quickly. Then, I could use
that to solve SAT quickly. so, if you can

95
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:14,123
prove any problem on this set, you can
reduce any problem on this set. To your

96
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:21,236
new problem that's like proving that SAT
reduces to it. So, if we adopt the idea

97
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:28,348
that SAT is intractable it means that all
of these problems are intractable. These

98
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:35,547
are lots of important problems that people
were looking for solutions and couldn't

99
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:42,572
find good solutions to, and, what Karp
shows in the Travelling Salesman problem

100
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:48,713
and the Hamilton Path problem which is the
like problem. Finding the that's the

101
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:55,569
problem of finding a path on the graph
that visits all the vertices. So what,

102
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:01,527
what Karp showed is that all of these
problems are intractable. They're all as

103
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:09,030
least as difficult to SAP, as SAP. if we
had a efficient polynomial times solution

104
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:16,048
to any one of them, we'd have a polynomial
time solution to SAP. that was Quite a

105
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:24,227
powerful idea of using polynomial time
reduction to classify problems in this

106
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:32,406
way. In fact, it's such a powerful idea
that nowadays there's maybe 6000 papers

107
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:38,329
per year. with reductions from some
problem that has, been shown to reduce

108
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,588
from SAT to some new problem. and these
are, important problems in, all fields of

109
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:50,492
human endeavor. so, for example, the so
called protein folding problem. Which, in

110
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:56,822
biochemistry, where, people are trying to
understand what's going on, in, living

111
00:11:56,822 --> 00:12:03,011
organisms. has been reduced from SAT. We'd
like to solve that problem. But, and that

112
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:09,775
would help us understand what's going in,
in living organisms. much better. but if

113
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:15,197
we had a, an efficient solution for, a
guaranteed polynomial time solution to

114
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:20,262
that problem. We'd have a, a, a,
guaranteed polynomial time solution to

115
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:25,969
SAT. and so we don't think so, Or,
economics, With, if you just make the

116
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:31,106
arbitrage problem a little more
complicated and a little more realistic.

117
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,455
where, there's, a little cost involved
with doing things. it turns out to be,

118
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:42,633
that, you can't have an efficient
solution. Not to that one unless, cause it

119
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:48,628
would imply an efficient solution to SAP.
and many, many other examples. Voting

120
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:55,858
power and politics. Experimental design
and statistics. Thousands and thousands of

121
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:04,000
papers per year involving reductions from
sap. Very, very powerful concept, that the

122
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,820
idea of reducing from sets. Now, we have
two ways to classify problems. We can,

123
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:18,628
find a polynomial time algorithm and then
we know problems in P, or we can develop a

124
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:25,345
polynomial time reduction from set and
that'll prove that at least if you believe

125
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:30,900
that sat is difficult you should believe
that'll be difficult to find a solution to

126
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,720
your problem. so that's the first step in
classifying problems.
