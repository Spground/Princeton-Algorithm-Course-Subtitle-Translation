1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,925
Today we're going to look at substring
search algorithms.

2
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,022
This is a really fascinating family of
algorithms.

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:13,668
The problem is very simple to state.
And the algorithms we're going to look at

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:16,890
are among the most ingenious that we've
seen, so far.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,384
So it's useful to introduce the problem,
very simple to state the problem.

6
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:28,030
We have two strings, one we call the
pattern and the other we call the text.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,963
And usually, it's good to think of the
pattern as relatively small, and the text

8
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:38,470
as relatively long.
In fact, usually we want to think of text

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,150
as unlimited length, coming in on an input
stream.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,934
And we have a small pattern, we want to
find out if the pattern occurs in the

11
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,700
text.
So you're doing this.

12
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:54,136
All the time.
When you do a, a simple search.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,311
On your computer or on the web.
And there's practical applications where,

14
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:08,810
for various reasons, people want to search
the entire contents of memory or disc for

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,101
a particular pattern, to make sure to
check for whether there's something in the

16
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:18,955
computer that's of interest.
And again, you've got to, such an

17
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,872
application you've got a small pattern and
maybe a huge text.

18
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:27,882
Or maybe you're looking for your e-mail
which you can think of as a continuous

19
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:33,020
stream of stuff coming in nowadays, and
you want to look for patterns that might

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,671
indicate that there's spam and certainly
you're all familiar with these types of

21
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,154
patterns.
And so what we want is to be able to

22
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:47,526
identify the pattern quickly and
efficiently in a huge text file.

23
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:53,190
That's the, one of the most important
indicators of skipped spam, I guess.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,586
.
Okay.

25
00:01:54,586 --> 00:02:00,034
So we'll try to set this up.
This isn't really a real situation but

26
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:05,401
it's not too far actually.
And so we're going to have these few

27
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:11,418
characters to try to point out the kinds
of issues that might be involved.

28
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:15,158
So imagine an Internet surveillance
situation.

29
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:21,420
Where there's a need to monitor what's on
the Internet for needs of security.

30
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:27,393
But there might be a, a judge saying, wait
a minute, you can't be looking at all

31
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:32,482
Internet traffic.
That's private information particularly

32
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:36,760
among private individuals in, in the U S
for example.

33
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:40,770
Well,
So what about if we just look for this one

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,422
pattern, that, we really need to know
about and that, that, really shouldn't

35
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:49,620
violate anybody's privacy, like tank or
dorm.

36
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:55,412
And the Judge can say, okay, how about if
you build a machine that just looks for

37
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,578
that?
And that's what we're going to talk about

38
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,552
today, actually.
One of the techniques that we look at is

39
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:08,615
perfect for, actually building hardware,
that can, be, put on, a stream of data

40
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:14,003
passing by, and just light the light if,
that, particular pattern is seen.

41
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:19,863
So you attach one of those machines, all
over the web, and, if attack at dawn

42
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:24,793
happens, then you find it.
That's the I would say a simplified

43
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:29,070
explanation of what it is that we're going
to try to do.

44
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:35,604
Here's another kind of application.
This is called, screen scraping.

45
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:43,096
So, we might want to and, and you can do
this, write programs to do this for,

46
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:51,411
extracting relevant data from a webpage.
And the idea is that there's different

47
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:57,215
institutions out there that are committed
to providing information on the web.

48
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:03,808
And they'll promise to, for example this
is Yahoo's page that gives the stock price

49
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:07,534
of Google.
When you look at the page, it says last

50
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:13,983
trade but if you write a program to look
at the code that produces the page it also

51
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:18,403
says last trade.
And since this HTML code is produced by a

52
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:21,048
program.
It's always going to have the same

53
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,630
structure.
So if we want to find, write a program to

54
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:34,034
find Google's stock price at any time what
we can do is take this page put it on an

55
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:38,971
input stream, and search for the pattern,
last trade.

56
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:44,148
And then just after last pray, trade,
there's the price, in bold.

57
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:50,599
So what we really want is the string
between, B and backslash B, which delimits

58
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:55,218
bold, after the first occurrence of the
pattern last trade.

59
00:04:55,457 --> 00:05:00,554
And it's simple to write a Java program
that, implements this.

60
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:05,890
This is the program, and, the key is,
well, number one, our input.

61
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,759
Standard N, input stream methods.
Allow a webpage, as argument.

62
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,682
So in this case, we provide a command line
argument, which is whatever company you

63
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:25,747
want the quote for.
And we simple read in the whole webpage.

64
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:30,150
So now you have the webpage in a long
string.

65
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,793
And then Java.
Has a, what's, index of method for every

66
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:41,185
string.
And it tells you, where that particular

67
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:47,370
string occurs.
And so, we'll start at index of last, last

68
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,852
trade.
And then, what we wanna do is find the

69
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,880
first B.
In brackets after that position.

70
00:05:55,096 --> 00:06:00,800
And the first being closed with backslash
being brackets, starting from that

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,626
position.
And skipping over the, angle bracket b

72
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:08,741
closed bracket.
You get the price, and you can print it

73
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:12,510
out.
Now this is a little utility that screen

74
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,996
scraps from Yahoo's website.
So sub string searching is quite in quite

75
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:24,691
useful in it's built in as a method in
Java's string data type.

76
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:28,884
So it's practically useful that's an
introduction.

77
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:32,760
So now let's look at algorithms for
implementing.

78
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:35,380
String searching.
