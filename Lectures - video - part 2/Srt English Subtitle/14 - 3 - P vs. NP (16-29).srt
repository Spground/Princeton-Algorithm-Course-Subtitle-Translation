1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,987
Now we're going to talk about P and NP,
the two major classes of problems that

2
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:15,457
form the basis for the theory of
intractability. and so we've talked about

3
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:22,396
search problems and what we're going to do
is just name that class of problems and

4
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:28,168
that's what we call NP. NP is the class of
all search problems. now I just want to

5
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:34,805
mention again that the classic definition
that's often used in, in many books and

6
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:41,039
papers that you'll read about this topic.
the classic definition limits NP to yes/no

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,992
problems. but again, the major conclusions
that we draw are exactly the same. so, we

8
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:54,137
just listed a bunch of problems that are
in NP. And the way that we know is we had

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:01:01,368
a very concrete definition of what we mean
by a search problem. you have to be able

10
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:08,338
to given a solution, you have to be able
to verify in guaranteed polynomial time

11
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:14,960
that you have a solution. and for
satisfiability problems that we considered

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,297
and factor all are in the class NP. so we,
we're using the concept of a search

13
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:28,198
problem to classify some problems. One way
to think of NP is it's, it's really what

14
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:35,773
we would like to be able to compute. We'd
like to have algorithms that solve all of

15
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:42,112
these problems. and it's a very, very
general class of problems that's like,

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:51,663
it's almost articulating in as general way
as possible what we mean by a problem that

17
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:57,010
we want to solve computationally. So,
these are the problems that we'd like to

18
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,636
solve. Some of them we can, we know how to
solve, some of them we don't. that's the

19
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:11,296
NP. now, by contrast, there is another
class P where we add a, a restriction and

20
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:17,518
that's the class of search problems that
we know how to solve in polynomial time.

21
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:23,894
So, that is we have, generally we have we
prove that problems in P by demonstrating

22
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:30,500
an algorithm that is guaranteed to run in
polynomial time for any instance of that

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,493
problem. And again, the classic definition
is about yes/no problems. so here's bunch

24
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:43,502
of problems that are in P. and so we
already showed L solve cuz Gaussian

25
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:49,532
elimination runs in polynomial time. And
we already talked about LP cuz algorithm

26
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:54,953
works for linear program, programming. and
then pretty much all the algorithms that

27
00:02:54,953 --> 00:03:01,237
we've covered in this course like are cast
as search problems. And also can, have

28
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:08,323
polynomial time solutions. We've been
talking about programs that are polynomial

29
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:15,498
time solutions and just a little bit has
to be done to convince yourself that, or

30
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:22,672
to cast the problem as a search problem
that many of them are explicit as search

31
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:27,763
problems, like ST connectivity. You're
searching for a path in a graph you know,

32
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:32,236
and, and Theseus and the minotaur, you
know, showed if you, if you are given a

33
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:36,876
path, you can check that it's a path
easily. So, it's a search problem. so P is

34
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:42,705
the class of search problems that can be
solvable in polynomial time. so the

35
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:48,128
significance of p is, those are the ones
that we actually do compute feasibly. So,

36
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:53,754
NP's the ones, all the ones we would like
to, and P is all the ones that we actually

37
00:03:53,754 --> 00:04:00,124
do compute feasibly. and those are
perfectly well defined classes of

38
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:07,925
problems. now, what is the N and NP for?
Well, just the, a brief moment to talk

39
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:14,617
about that. the N and NP stands for
non-determinism. and the idea of a

40
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:20,930
non-deterministic machine is one that can
guess the desired solution. and that's an

41
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,875
abstract machine. as far as we know, we
don't have non-determinism in real life

42
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:32,894
devices. but in, but it's fine to have an
abstract machine of that sort. Remember,

43
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:38,913
for our implementation for regular
expression pattern matching, the way that

44
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:44,638
we solved that practical problem was to
image a non-deterministic machine. And

45
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:50,820
then, write a program that would simulate
that machine by trying all different

46
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:59,222
possibilities. and, in fact, that whole
exercise really gets at the difference

47
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:07,068
between polynomial exponential time. first
approach is the naive approach to

48
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:12,979
simulating that machine turns out to be an
algorithm that can run in exponential time

49
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,547
for some inputs. And we actually saw that
today there's implementations like that

50
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:24,184
out there that hackers can exploit to deny
service. The implementation we show had

51
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:28,817
guaranteed polynomial time. So,
non-determinism was an abstract device

52
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:34,504
that we used to help us try to get to a
real practical solution and that's what

53
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:39,993
we're doing again. So, let's imagine, we
have a non-deterministic machine that can

54
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:48,242
guess the solution. so like if you're in,
in a deterministic machine, if you make a,

55
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:56,514
an array and create an array of size n,
then it, Java we know deterministically,

56
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:03,053
initializes the entries to all zero. but
what if that array A is supposed to be our

57
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:08,083
solution to a integer linear programming
problem? we could have a non-deterministic

58
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:12,934
machine initialize the entries to the
solution. They could just guess what the

59
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:18,042
right answer is and initialize it. So, it
seems like a really, really powerful

60
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:24,992
capability. so for example, for integer
linear programming, we could just tell the

61
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:31,722
non-deterministic machine guess the
solution and we'd be done. and the same

62
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:37,536
concept goes all the way down to a touring
machine. the whole idea of the finite

63
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:43,224
state machine or of any computation that
people think about is the machine's in

64
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:48,081
some state, and it's fully determined what
the next state will be. And Turing

65
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:53,705
machine's the simplest type of imaginary
machine with that kind of capability. But

66
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:58,881
it's very simple to make a Turing machine
non-deterministic, the same way that we

67
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:04,249
made Finite Automata non-deterministic.
You just let it go to more than one

68
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:10,680
possible state. So, when you think about
non-determinism in this way, it is pretty

69
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,260
clear almost immediately that NP is a
class of search problems that are solvable

70
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,003
in polynomial time on a non-deterministic
Turing machine. Even, if the machine gives

71
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:30,745
the solution, what we requiring is that we
have to be able to check that there is a

72
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:38,396
solution in polynomial time. and that's,
that's NP. So, what we have led to

73
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:44,968
immediately is the, what's called the
extended Church-Turing thesis. and that's

74
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:52,050
the idea that P is, is the ones that we
know how to solve, but it's the class of

75
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,022
the problems that we ever going to be able
to solve in the, in the natural world. and

76
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:04,072
again evidence were supporting the thesis
is that all the computers that we know

77
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:10,432
about were simulating in polynomial time.
people wondered, have wondered and still

78
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:16,792
wonder, is it possible that there are
computers out there that work differently

79
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:22,556
or more efficiently than the computers
that we built. here's the an interesting

80
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:27,330
and simple example. there's a thing called
a Steiner tree, which is like an MST,

81
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,986
except you're not restricted to have your
lines go through the points that are

82
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:36,680
given. Steiner tree you're given some
points. And what you're supposed to do is

83
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,821
find a set of lines of minimal length that
connect the end points. Now, this is quite

84
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,717
a bit of math and geometry even to prove
that a given set of lines is a Steiner

85
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:51,919
tree. But like for four points it's known
like this, in a rectangle or array. that's

86
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,060
what the Steiner tree looks like. Can we
write a program to compute Steiner trees?

87
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:04,423
it's a search problem. And although that
it's not, not completely easy to

88
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:10,548
characterize as a search problem, but it
is. But anyway, the point for now is that

89
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:17,132
people wondered actually if you put soap
in between two glasses, the film formed by

90
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:23,028
the soap or soap bubbles is another way to
think about it. But this is a two, making

91
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:29,229
it two-dimensional if you put four points
and put soap and people have done this

92
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:35,090
experiment, that's a photo off the, off
the web, you get a Steiner tree. and, you

93
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:42,489
know, who knows what kind of computation
is involved to make that. if you put lots

94
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:49,037
of points, people have done I, I, I don't
know what number. but they can get Steiner

95
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:55,234
trees for substantial numbers of points.
can we really compute Steiner trees that

96
00:09:55,234 --> 00:10:02,000
way? Well, you can construct things where
it doesn't actually get the actual Steiner

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,627
tree. So, it doesn't really work. and
that's just one example of an attempt.

98
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:13,966
there's plenty other examples out there.
but the Chur, extended Church-Turing

99
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:20,018
thesis hasn't been with us for as long as
the Church Turing thesis and maybe it's

100
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:25,246
not quite as strong, but it's held for
quite a, quite a long time. and people are

101
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:30,629
assuming that there's not going to be a
design that's going to make the differ

102
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:35,901
ence between polynomial time in this
natural world. if we're going to make

103
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:40,930
future computers more efficient, we're
just going to improve our existing

104
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:48,275
designs. that's the extended church term
thesis. but it leaves us with all of this

105
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:54,079
leads us with a basic question. Does P
equal NP? so P is all the problems we can

106
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,773
solve in the natural world, and P is all
the search problems that would like to

107
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:04,286
solve. if we had non-determinism in the
natural world do we have non-determinism

108
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:09,700
in the natural world? Does non-determinism
help? that's the question. Does P equals

109
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,372
NP? this question has been around for a
long time and has even made it into the

110
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:21,624
popular culture. and I think it'll make it
into the popular culture much more when we

111
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:27,231
start having because we're starting to
have massive online courses where many

112
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:33,001
more people are learning about these
fabulous concepts. now here's another way

113
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:39,722
to think about P versus NP. it's the like
idea of automating creativity. it's one

114
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:46,287
thing to be creative, it's another thing
to appreciate creativity. so Mozart comes

115
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:52,695
up with music, a piece of music. Once that
thing is created, we can appreciate it. Or

116
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:59,650
Andrew Wiles proved with his last theorem
and however he came up with it, there's a

117
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,470
way to check it, somebody can check it. or
a, somebody designs an, an air, air foiler

118
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,992
or airplane wing, we can verify that it
has the properties it's suppose to. or

119
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:19,200
Einstein proposes a theory, somebody can
validate it. So, there's the creative

120
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:25,958
let's, let's, let's make something or, or
come up with something, that's the analog

121
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:32,559
to that is a solution to a problem, a
search problem. and the ordinary thing to

122
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:39,282
do is to check it. but if P equals NP,
there's no difference. we can, we, it's

123
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:46,983
really like automating creativity. that's
the computational an analog to P equals NP

124
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:53,993
question is the computational analog to
automating creativity. Is P equals NP?

125
00:12:53,993 --> 00:13:01,523
That's the central question. , can you
always avoid before searching and do

126
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:08,249
better? for search problems, since we have
a small solution that can be checked in

127
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:13,899
palonomial time, ther e's always a
exponential time solution, which is try

128
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,912
all possible solutions. but that's not,
the question is, can you can you always do

129
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:27,172
better than that? That's the, the, the
essence of the P equals NP question. so

130
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:34,175
there's two possibilities. If P, if P is
not, if P is a search problem so it's

131
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:41,454
certainly an NP. Any problem in NP is also
in P. so, the question is are there some

132
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:49,285
problems, some search problems that we
can't solve in polynomial time? so if the

133
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:56,031
answer to the question is yes, then all
the problems that I've mentioned that

134
00:13:56,031 --> 00:14:02,402
nobody knows the solution to despite
people working on them for many decades.

135
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:08,932
if P is equal to NP there's polynomial
times out, algorithms for those out there,

136
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:15,380
we just haven't found them yet. if the
answer to that is no, if that that's

137
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:23,860
really something fundamental about our
universe that, that something, said

138
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:31,992
something profound about the power of
non-determinism, non-determinism. If, if P

139
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:42,436
equals NP, non-determinism actually
doesn't help, not equal NP. it would, now,

140
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:48,990
the overwhelming consensus is that P
equals, not equal to NP. and we'll talk

141
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:56,805
some more about some reasons that people
believe that. but when thinking about it

142
00:14:56,553 --> 00:15:03,742
and you can really convince yourself that
it really seems as though having a

143
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:09,492
machine. And a machine that can when you
initialize a ray, an array, initialize it

144
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:14,774
with a solution to a integer linear
programming problem really would seem that

145
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:20,390
a machine like that is going to be more
powerful than the machines that we're

146
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,140
using. and that's why people believe that
P is not equal to NP. But the frustrating

147
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,088
thing is that, theoretical computer
scientist, and mathematicians have been

148
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:37,618
working on this for many, many years and
no one has been able to prove it. actually

149
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:47,290
there's the Millenium Prize. you can earn
a million dollars from Clay Mathematics

150
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,455
Institute if you resolve PNP.
Equals NP. actually there's other math

151
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:59,261
problems on that list and but people who
know algorithms. First of all, you could

152
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:04,662
learn, earn way more than a million
dollars if, if you resolve this problem.

153
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:10,130
second of all, if you're expert in
algorithms, there's lots of other ways to

154
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,936
earn a million dollars. so it's not about
the million dollars, it's about this is

155
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:22,484
some would argue one of the most important
open mathematical questions that faces us

156
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:23,160
right now.
