1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,248
Today we're going to talk about tries,
which is a data structure for searching

2
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:14,988
with string keys that is remarkable
effective in enabling us to deal with huge

3
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:18,549
amounts of data that we have to process
nowadays.

4
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:25,016
Just as a motivation, when we left off
talking about searching algorithms, or the

5
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:28,868
symbol table implementations here's where
we were.

6
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:34,972
The best algorithms that we examined were
balanced red, black, binary search trees,

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,144
in hash tables.
And With respect to the basic search,

8
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:45,087
insert and delete operations.
Red black BSTs we're able to guarantee

9
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:50,297
that we can get those done in logorithmic
time, actually, pretty efficiently.

10
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:55,574
And for hashing, we'd get'em done in
constant time under certain assumptions.

11
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:58,647
That we could have a uniform, hash
function.

12
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:04,258
And also, for hashing, what we need to
compute a hash, code for binary search

13
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:09,468
trees, we use, a compare to function.
And another difference is, binary search

14
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:14,792
trees, we can support more operations.
Than we can support with hashing ordered

15
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:18,357
operations.
For example, getting the rank of a key in

16
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:22,441
the tree, and other things.
And those are terrific algorithms.

17
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:27,237
And we looked at plenty of go, good
applications of those algorithms.

18
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:30,673
But still there's the question could we do
better?

19
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,720
And the answer is that yes, we can do
better.

20
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,615
As with string sorting, we can avoid
examining the entire key.

21
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:45,046
Which is going to give us algorithms that
can compete and even beat these classic

22
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:49,260
algorithms.
So to get started we are going to

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,337
articulate in API for symbol tables that
specialize for the case when the keys are

24
00:01:56,337 --> 00:02:00,804
strings.
So simply, we just add the modifier string

25
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:07,980
to our standard symbol table EPI.
And we can take a generic value just put

26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,913
the keys or strings.
And then we take all the methods that we

27
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:19,099
articulated before.
And for key type, instead of generic, we

28
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,070
use string.
And this is going to allow us to develop

29
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,418
efficient algorithms that take advantage
of properties of strings.

30
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:34,495
Our goal is to get, some algorithms that
are even faster than hashing.

31
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:41,221
And maybe, more flexible than BSTs.
And we're going to be able to achieve both

32
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:47,347
those goals.
So, this again is the summary of the

33
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:54,818
running times for when, in the case that
the keys are strings for red black BSTs

34
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,378
and for hashing.
And let's take a look at those so if L is

35
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:05,644
the length of the string.
And n is the number of strings and then

36
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:11,092
also the rate x is r is going to be a
factor later on but its not going to be

37
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:15,128
for these two.
Then for hashing for every operation we

38
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,778
have to compute a hash function, which
basically means looking at every character

39
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:25,608
in the string.
Actually in Java string hash functions are

40
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:31,201
cached, so sometimes there's efficiencies
cuz you only have to comp, and they're

41
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:35,225
mutable, so you only have to compute the
hash function once.

42
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,023
And then this is roughly the amount of
space that takes into account the table

43
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:46,753
and the string size for red black BSTs,
the analysis is a bit more complicated.

44
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,710
For a search hit, you have to look at the
entire string.

45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,404
Given a entire key to check that every
character's the same and then the

46
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:00,654
comparison's depending on the nature of
the keys for a typical case though its

47
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:06,152
something like log squared N. we had log N
comparison's but usually you have to look

48
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:11,896
at something like a log N characters in
the key in order to get down the tree.

49
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:17,085
For a search miss you might be able to
find out before you get to the end of the

50
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:22,150
tree and sing a for an insert so the
running times are something like this.

51
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:28,933
Then here's some experimental evidence
that, that we, we can use to test out

52
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:35,039
these analytic hypothesis.
And we'll just look at two examples one is

53
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:41,747
the entire text of Melville's Moby Dick
which we've used before and that's about a

54
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:45,226
million characters.
And maybe 200,000 strings.

55
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:49,319
And add to this 200,000 strings, about
32,000 are distinct.

56
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,482
And then this,
There's another file of actors from the

57
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:59,127
Internet movie database that's much bigger
maybe tourism magnitude bigger.

58
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,361
And it's got maybe about a million
different words.

59
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:09,909
So we'll want our algorithms to do better
than, or at least as well as red black

60
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:15,826
BSTs in hashing on these data sets.
I think, you know, our test is to dedupe

61
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:18,891
these data sets.
So that's our challenge.

62
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:24,737
Efficient performance for string keys and
try to come up with algorithms that can

63
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:30,945
compete with the best classic algorithms.
Now in order to do that we're going to

64
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:35,976
look at R way tries.
That's a particular data structure, that

65
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:39,704
was, invented actually really quite a
while ago.

66
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:43,507
This data structure, dates back, to the
60s.

67
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:50,218
And, the first thing to know about it is
that, the name is based a little bit, on a

68
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,797
pun.
It actually is the middle letters of the

69
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:59,987
word retrieval, but we don't pronounce it
tree because then we couldn't distinguish

70
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,790
it from binary search trees, so we
pronounce it try.

71
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:09,569
And this is a confusing fact of life that
we've been living with for many decades

72
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,397
now with this data structure.
And let's look at what a try is and we'll

73
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:17,864
look at some, examples before we get to
the code.

74
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:22,012
So, for now, we're going to think of a try
as some nodes.

75
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:26,568
A tree structure with nodes where we store
characters in the nodes,

76
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:30,401
Not keys.
And the other thing is that each node has

77
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:35,628
R children, where R is the rate, it's the
number of possible characters.

78
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:41,070
And there's g-, the possibility of a child
for each possible character.

79
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:46,305
Now in the standard implementation, this
is going to involve on all links.

80
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:50,348
We have to have a placeholder for each
possible character.

81
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:55,650
So there's a lot of null links and tries.
And we'll get back to that in a minute.

82
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,754
But to get the concept, we'll use this
graphical representation, where we have

83
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,399
characters and nodes and we don't show any
null length.

84
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,767
And the other thing is, remember a symbol
table is associating a key with a value,

85
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:13,678
so this try is built for this set of key
value pairs.

86
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:18,290
And what we do is we.
Store values in nodes that correspond to

87
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,117
the last characters in keys.
And we'll look, that's what these numbers

88
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:26,386
here are.
And we'll look at a little more in detail,

89
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:30,680
on how this try is built in just a second.
So that's the basic idea.

90
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,230
We're going to have string keys.
We're going to associate values, and we're

91
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,357
going to use this tree-like, tree data
structure but we're not going to draw the

92
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:45,019
imply null links for now.
So, for example, in this trie so the root

93
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:50,641
re-, represents all strings.
And, coming out of the root is one length

94
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:55,307
for each possible letter.
In particular in this try, the middle link

95
00:07:55,307 --> 00:08:00,600
is the link to the, to a sub try that
contains all the keys that start with S.

96
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,334
Then we go further down.
Each time we go by a node, we pick off a

97
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:13,413
letter so that this length, for example,
goes to the try for all keys that start

98
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:17,547
with s followed by h followed by e.
And so forth.

99
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:23,689
So now all, out of all the keys that start
with SHE, actually one of them, the one

100
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:29,062
that just has the letters in then ends,
has a value associated with it.

101
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:35,050
So when the node corresponding to the last
letter, the E, we put the value zero.

102
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,445
And so that's, how the try is going to
look.

103
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:44,424
So just given that definition, then let's
look at, how to do search, in a try.

104
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:50,181
All we do is use the characters and the
key to guide our search down the data

105
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,116
structure.
So, let's say we're looking for the key

106
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,584
shells.
So we start at the root, and we go down

107
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:03,448
the S link, since we started with an S.
Now our second letter is H, so we look to

108
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:09,460
see if there's a non-null link that,
corresponding to H, and in this case there

109
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,651
is.
Now our next letter is E, so we look for

110
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:13,320
an E.
Now.

111
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,995
No need to examine the value here because
well we haven't looked at all the letters

112
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:22,914
in our key yet.
So now we look for L now we look for

113
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:28,860
another L and then finally we find the S
and when we find the S we look to see if

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,049
there's a value there.
In this case there is a value and so

115
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:37,847
that's what we return the value associated
with the last key character.

116
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:41,842
So that's a typical search hit in a tri.
Another way is...

117
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:45,139
So, that node was down at the bottom but
if you had.

118
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,629
We're doing a search for SHE, you follow
the same path.

119
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,994
But now when you get to the E, that's the
last character of that key and so we just

120
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,808
know how to return that, value associated
with that node.

121
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:01,945
That is, the search doesn't have to go all
the way to the bottom.

122
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,724
It might terminate at an intermediate
node.

123
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:09,896
And we just return the value associated
with the node corresponding to the last

124
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:13,063
character in the key.
What about a search miss?

125
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:16,151
Well, there's two cases.
It's for a search miss.

126
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,904
So one of them is we've followed down the
tree picking off the letters in the key

127
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:28,264
one letter at a time as, as before.
And then when we get to the end of the key

128
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:34,251
we take a look to see if there is a value.
In this case there's no value associated

129
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:39,681
with the last key character that mean
there's no key in the data structure

130
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,650
that's been associated with a value.
So we just return no.

131
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,746
Or, the other thing that can happen is, we
can, reach a null link.

132
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:54,729
So, our key now is S, starts with S, and
then H, and then E, and then L, and now

133
00:10:54,729 --> 00:11:00,860
our next letter is T, so we look to see if
there's a non null link coming from this

134
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,587
node associated with T.
And in this case, there's no such link, so

135
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:10,167
we return null.
That's evidence that, that string, there's

136
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:14,377
no key associated with that string in our
data structure.

137
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,442
So that's a search miss.
Iii.

138
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:21,070
Now, what about insertion?
Well insertion is also pretty simple.

139
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,690
So we follow two, two rules.
One is again, we go down links

140
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,360
corresponding each character in the key.
If we come out on a link, we create a new

141
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,490
node that's associated with the character
that we're on.

142
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,300
And just keep doing that until we get to
the last character of the key, in which

143
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,136
case, we put the value.
So if in this try, we're supposed to

144
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,879
associate the value seven with
[inaudible].

145
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,046
We follow, our path from the root to s,
'cause our first letter is s, and then

146
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,958
h.'Cause our next letter is h.
And then a O, we had an, [inaudible] kinda

147
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,040
ran into a null link.
So we have to put, a node there, with the

148
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,719
character, associated with the character
O.

149
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:10,014
So in later searches for this key, we'll
be able to find it by passing through that

150
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,821
node.
And now we move to the next letter, and

151
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:16,840
there's no node again.
In the next letter, there's still no node.

152
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,125
Iii.
When we get to the end, then that's the

153
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,910
last character in the key, and we put our
value seven.

154
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,224
And now we've modified the data structure,
adding the nodes that are necessary for a

155
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:36,030
later search to go through, character by
character and find the value associated

156
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,514
with that key.
So that's an insertion into a try.

157
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:46,119
Just to cement all these ideas let's do a
demo of how that tree was constructed from

158
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:50,045
scratch.
So we have a null try.

159
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:58,215
So we're going to start by putting the,
associating the value zero with the string

160
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:02,662
SHE.
So we start at the root node, which, and

161
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:10,625
I'll try, it just has that one node.
Create a new node for S, create a new node

162
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:15,590
for H, create a new node for E.
Associate zero.

163
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,004
So the key is the sequence of characters
from the root to the value, and the value

164
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:24,371
is in the node corresponding to the last
character.

165
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:29,257
This try represents the symbol table that
contains just on string SHE, and

166
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:33,351
associated with zero.
Every other string, if you search for any

167
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:38,963
other string in this try you'll either end
in a node that doesn't have a value or

168
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:44,050
you'll end at a null link.
All right, so now, let's say we put in the

169
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,381
key S, E, L, L, S and you can kinda tell
where it's going, we made room for it in

170
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:54,410
the try.
So we go for S, and now the second letter,

171
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,767
E, corresponds to a null link, so we
create a new node.

172
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:05,838
And similarly we go through and create new
nodes for each of the remaining characters

173
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:10,360
in the key and then associate the value
one at the end.

174
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:16,510
So now we have a try that has two keys in
it, SHE and SELLS.

175
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,648
Now our next is to insert SEA.
So now we have S, we already have a node

176
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:26,126
corresponding to E.
And so now we just have to create one new

177
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:30,531
node, the one corresponding to A.
And put our value two there.

178
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:36,330
And now, we're going to put SHELLS in.
So we already have the S, already have the

179
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,129
H, already have the E, so now we have to
add nodes for the last three letters in

180
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:45,800
that string.
And associate the value three with it.

181
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,865
Now we're going to put finally a key that
doesn't start with S.

182
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:54,833
So that means we create a new node
corresponding to the first letter of that

183
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:59,480
string, I, N to the other letter two.
And then associate the value four.

184
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,224
And here's another one that doesn't start
with s.

185
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:06,761
So we create new nodes corresponding to
each one of its characters, and associate

186
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:10,178
the value five with the last one.
Now here's SEA.

187
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:18,860
So this is, remember, our symbol table API
is associative, which means that if we get

188
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,450
a new value for a key that's already in
the table, we overwrite.

189
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:32,079
The old value with the new value.
That's the way, the convention that we've

190
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,349
chosen for symbol tables.
So that is easily done with tries as well.

191
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:44,620
Now here's one more key, S, H.
And now we have to add a new node because

192
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,174
there's no node that's a child of H that
corresponds letter O.

193
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:57,341
So we have to create new nodes for O, R,
and E, and associate the value seven with

194
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:00,522
it.
So that's a tri that has precisely eight

195
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,648
keys.
If you look for any one of those eight

196
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:08,549
keys you'll get the value.
If you look for any other string you'll

197
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:14,658
either come to a node that has a null
value or go out on a null link and so the

198
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:19,560
search would be unsuccessful.
That's is a demo of tri construction.

199
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:27,464
Now that you have a basic idea of how,
what tris are and how they work, let's

200
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:32,299
take a look at what's needed to implement
them in Java.

201
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:39,771
The key idea in the tri representation for
implementation in Java or any computer

202
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:48,297
language is that. Instead of representing
a node as a character in the node, what we

203
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:55,521
do is represent the links as an indexed
array with one entry for each possible

204
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:59,636
character.
And the idea is the characters are

205
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:03,253
actually.
Implicitly defined by link indeces.

206
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:08,600
So just for example, we have this small
try that we built over here.

207
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,510
In this case, the root has only one node
below it.

208
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,656
That's for all the keys that start with S.
The way that's represented in real

209
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:22,007
representation, and this is for
efficiency.

210
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,918
And it's the way that tries get their
efficiency.

211
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:30,547
Is we have one link corresponding to each
possible letter.

212
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:36,953
And the only one that is un-null is S.
So the character S is defined implicitly

213
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:43,535
by the fact that, that link that
[inaudible] that, that corresponds to S is

214
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:48,472
not null.
Over here there's from e to a there's two

215
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:54,067
links coming out of E.
And the only way that we represent A is by

216
00:17:54,067 --> 00:18:00,238
having the first link be not null.
If the link corresponding to a letter is

217
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:07,150
not null, then it corresponds to having
that letter in the node that it points to.

218
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,952
So in this case we have E connected to A
and L.

219
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:16,960
So we have the entries corresponding to A
and L filled with non null values.

220
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,022
So you can see immediately the
correspondence between this tri the way

221
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:27,774
we've been drawing it and the job
representation of it.

222
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:33,836
Where each node contains 200, or r links
if there's r different letters.

223
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:39,326
And letters are implicitly represented by
non [inaudible] links.

224
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:44,580
Now, you just go in the node.
So for example, I, in this try, S, E, A,

225
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,724
but which is easy to follow down through
the try.

226
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:53,788
We're looking for an S.
And S is the twentieth letter in the

227
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:54,957
alphabet.
Or so.

228
00:18:54,957 --> 00:19:00,103
We index into the twentieth position and
that takes us right to S.

229
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:03,845
And E's the fifth letter, we take the
fifth link.

230
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:07,665
Then A's the first letter, we take the
first link.

231
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:12,421
So we can use the character as index into
the array of links.

232
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:18,190
To quickly travel down the tree.
Then when we get to the last character, we

233
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,790
can check the value at that node that's
stored in the node.

234
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,888
One slight complication in the
implementation that we encountered before

235
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:34,826
with hashing algorithms and other things.
We're going to need arrays of nodes.

236
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:40,363
That's what our lengths are.
So we can't have any generics with nodes,

237
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:46,060
even though I would like to.
So we have to declare the value to be a

238
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,319
type object, and then we'll have to cast
it back to whatever type it should be,

239
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,930
when we return it.
And we'll see that in code.

240
00:19:56,152 --> 00:20:01,258
Other than that little complication.
This is quite straightforward

241
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:05,328
representation of tries.
And it leads to a very easy

242
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:09,325
implementation.
So the keys and the characters are not

243
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:13,691
explicitly stored.
They're, they're implicitly, because of

244
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:17,761
the links.
And that's a, a very important point to

245
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:21,980
think about when it comes to, implementing
using tries.

246
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,599
Given that representation, this code for
implementing try, simple table in Java

247
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:34,946
almost writes itself.
So it's a [inaudible] implementation in

248
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:40,929
this slide has the implementation of put
using the same recursive scheme that was

249
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:46,692
used many other times in building trees
the what are the instance variables?

250
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:53,113
Well we declare artery 256 as usual in our
string implementations where working with

251
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:59,388
extended asking and then we have one
instance variable that matters and that is

252
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:04,976
the root of the [inaudible].
So tries begin with, start, all tries

253
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:10,775
start with a null node.
So first thing we do is create a new node

254
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:17,939
and put a reference to that node in root.
So our empty trie consists of a node

255
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:23,654
that's got a.
Remember, when you create a new node we

256
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:30,280
Build an array of R links to nodes.
And at the beginning those'll all be empty

257
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,100
links.
Or all null links.

258
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,448
So the root points to a node that has 256
null lengths.

259
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:42,171
Now to put.
Or to associate a key with the value in a

260
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:46,953
trie.
We use this instance method that calls

261
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:51,584
recursive method.
Again, the same way that we've done for

262
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:57,935
other tree construction schemes before.
So we take the recursive method, takes a

263
00:21:57,935 --> 00:22:04,135
node as argument and returns a node.
So it takes a reference to a trie and

264
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:08,170
returns to, a reference to the trie that
it constructs.

265
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:16,411
After a associating the key with a value.
Just to get started suppose that our first

266
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:22,260
key has just one character.
So in that case, we would call.

267
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,789
Another recursive put for the root, with
our one character.

268
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:35,313
And so our one character key.
And call the recursive routine.

269
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,845
Now our node is not null.
It's the root node.

270
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:46,915
So and our key is length one.
And we, called it starting at zero.

271
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:55,260
So the first thing that we do is pick out
the [inaudible] character of our, Yeah key

272
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:01,432
so zero of character which is our one
character and I guess its an index

273
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:07,603
whatever letter might happen to B.
Say its B then C would be two that's sort

274
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:14,100
of thing and then all we do is recursively
are follow that link in ser.

275
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:18,793
Our, associate our key value in the try
pointed to by that link.

276
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:25,264
And then take the link that we get and put
it back into that link out of the root

277
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:29,054
node.
So the next call there's nothing in the

278
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:35,010
word dot next it's a, it's null so the
next call we get null so we create a new

279
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,164
node.
And then that new node this point we've

280
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:41,808
called with D plus one moving to the next
character.

281
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:46,364
So now we have D equals one which is equal
to our key dot length.

282
00:23:46,364 --> 00:23:51,270
So we associate the value in that node
with our node and we return it.

283
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:57,578
So that return one level up will set the
length of the new node in the appropriate

284
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:04,672
entry corresponding to the root.
Again once you've learned our normal

285
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:12,566
recursive way of structuring building tree
structures this code is very natural.

286
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:20,726
So for a longer key I'm again thinking
recursively we find the if we're suppose

287
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:28,797
to insert the key associate the key with a
value, and we're working on the

288
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:34,343
[inaudible] character.
We pick out the, The character at the deep

289
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:37,377
position.
We use that to index and to be in link

290
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:43,343
array of the current node and then that's
the link that we set when we do a put of

291
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:47,136
the new node.
So when we start with a longer string and

292
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:53,205
a perfectly empty tree we create new nodes
all the way down and then put their links

293
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:57,550
to their parents all the way up.
In this recursive structure.

294
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:01,412
And it's a very simple and natural
recursive code.

295
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:05,687
So that's the put.
Now that takes a little study but not so

296
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:11,067
much once you're use to our standard
recursive way of producing tree

297
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:13,687
structures.
And get is even simpler.

298
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:19,842
So contains and gets.
So our scenario's standard convention is

299
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:28,336
to return null if we have a key that's not
there or that contains and the get

300
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:36,786
function is a again recursive.
Procedure that will return in reference to

301
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:40,322
the node, and if that's null, we return
null.

302
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:46,984
Otherwise, we can get the value out of the
node return by the recursive procedure.

303
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:52,411
And then remember we had the omega value
in nodes of type objects.

304
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:56,277
So we have to cast that back to the type
value.

305
00:25:56,277 --> 00:26:04,024
And the recursive get is very simple.
To find the node that contains the value

306
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:09,540
associated with a given key.
And we're working on the deep character.

307
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,326
And we're currently on, node x.
We just, return null.

308
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:18,626
Effects happens to be null.
That means it's not there.

309
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:24,710
If we're, at the last character in the
key, we return our current node.

310
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:28,650
Otherwise, we get that [inaudible]
character.

311
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,010
And we use that to index into the next
array of the current, node.

312
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:41,103
And recursively called the get routine,
for, that node moving, one down the tree.

313
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:47,802
And incrementing our key pointer by one.
Extremely simple, recursive code to do the

314
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:51,599
tri implementation.
So what about the performance?

315
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:58,218
Well in a cert chip we simply go down the
tried examining all L characters just

316
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:01,911
using each one to index into an x-array at
some note.

317
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,510
And then go down to the end to, to see if
there's a value there.

318
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:11,875
Search miss we might have to go all the
way down to the last character.

319
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:17,450
But we could also just have a miss match
on the first character and find a null

320
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,680
link right away.
And actually.

321
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,528
Typically, in a try.
In typical applications, we only examine a

322
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:28,544
few characters.
So right away, you can see, by thinking

323
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:33,090
about a search miss, that try algorithms
can be sublinear.

324
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,378
We can find out that a key's not in the
tree, by only examining a few characters.

325
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:44,032
If we don't have any.
Strings in our try that begin with the

326
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:49,057
same few characters as our search key,
then, it's not there.

327
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:55,260
That's a typical case.
Now the downside of tri performance in

328
00:27:55,542 --> 00:28:00,160
lots of applications is the amount of
space used.

329
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:05,804
There is the problem that every node's got
R lengths in it.

330
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:12,997
And particularly, down at the bottom, the
leaf nodes that correspond to the last

331
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:20,371
characters and keys and, the prefix in the
key in the try that's going to be null

332
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:24,337
lengths.
Now it is possible in a huge try with lots

333
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:30,510
of strings that are short and sharing
common prefixes to actually much less

334
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,360
space then this but be ardenal links at
each leaf is a real problem in some

335
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,480
applications so we're going to take a look
on how to deal with that.

336
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:51,479
So the bottom line is for symbol tables
with relatively small numbers of string

337
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:58,672
keys where the amount of space used by the
[UNKNOWN] is not a problem.

338
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,697
Then we get very fast, search hit.
And even faster search miss but we burn up

339
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:09,334
some space.
That's the bottom line about try

340
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:13,384
performance.
And, just a typical application.

341
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:19,996
Maybe you get a job interview question
about, what data structure you use for

342
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:28,234
spell checking And then, so, and this is
just an example, to show, how effective

343
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:34,377
tries can be for such an application.
Where all the words are three letters.

344
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:41,385
And the solution is, build a 26 way try.
So spell checking, usually, there'll be

345
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:47,842
pre-processing to strip out everything but
the lowercase letters that make up the

346
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,858
word.
So you can build a 26 way try that, will

347
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:56,820
immediately tell you whether you have a
misspelled word or not.

348
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:04,540
Another interesting thing about prize is
that, deletion is, very easy, what do we

349
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,646
do to delete a key value pair, well you
find, the node corresponding to key and,

350
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:16,208
set the value there corresponding to null,
.

351
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:23,489
So that's, easily done, so we want to
delete shelves we cross out the, value

352
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:30,174
there, and now, there's two cases.
One case is this one where that node, now

353
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:34,250
we set its' value to null and its got all
null links.

354
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,865
Now there's no reason for its existence.
So it wouldn't have been created except

355
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:46,940
for the fact that we inserted shells.
So if the node has got null links, just

356
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,239
remove it.
And then, just delete it.

357
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:57,322
And then when you go back up the tree,
which you do because you got down there.

358
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:05,416
Every node that you touch you check if
it's got a no value and all no links, just

359
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:10,024
delete it.
And you keep going until you find one that

360
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:17,377
has either a value or a downhill link and
then that's when you can stop the leading

361
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:21,491
node.
So it's pretty easy to delete a key value

362
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:26,481
pair in an R-way tri.
And that's unusual for other search

363
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:33,484
structures that we saw in the deletion was
a significant challenge to implement

364
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:37,350
often.
So our challenge is to find a way to use,

365
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:41,912
less memory.
Be, particularly because, nowadays, many

366
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:47,533
strings are built with Unicode.
And the number of null links in a tri

367
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:52,746
would be truly huge.
Again we talked about this, with rated

368
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:56,820
sorting.
A lot a programs broke when this.

369
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,190
Switch went from ASCII to Unicode.
In any program that use this reposession,

370
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:10,540
representation for Tries, certainly broke.
So that's an introduction to Tries with

371
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,520
R-way Tries.
