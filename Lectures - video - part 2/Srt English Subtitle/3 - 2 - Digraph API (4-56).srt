1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,689
. To develop. Digraph processing
Algorithms, we're going to need an A.P.I.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:15,617
We'll use the same design pattern that we
use for undirected graphs, where we

3
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:21,930
develop an A.P.I. for building graphs that
can serve as a client for all our graph

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,704
processing algorithms. And it's very
similar, it's not close to identical to

5
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:33,555
the undirected graph A.P.I., except the
class is named digraph. And other than

6
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:39,253
that. It's got add edge, where we add a
directed edge. But now, we're saying it's

7
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:45,212
an edge from V to W. and then an iterator.
that gives the vertices that point from

8
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:50,643
the given vertex. So we're getting, those
were the edges we can travel along to get

9
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:56,207
around the graph. We have V and E. and
another new method that is not relevant

10
00:00:56,207 --> 00:01:01,906
for undirected graphs is the reverse. So
that's, a, a method that returns a

11
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:07,873
di-graph where all the edges are reversed.
and we'll see that's an important method

12
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:13,129
to have for one of the algorithms that
we'll talk about today. so here's a

13
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:19,142
typical client very similar to the one
that we did for undirected graphs, where

14
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:25,081
we read the diagram from input stream, so
that's pairs of edges, pairs of vertices

15
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:32,267
where, that represent an edge from or one
vert, first vertex to the second one And

16
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:38,456
then for every vertex we'd print out. for
every edge that you can get to from that

17
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:44,154
verte-, for every other vertex you get to
from that vertex, we put out a,, print out

18
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:50,124
a little graphical representation of the
edge V2W, where the little arrow we use a

19
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:57,890
minus sign and a greater than. So for
example with the input file tinyDG.txt for

20
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:04,590
directograph, the one's got thirteen
vertices, 22 edges. It's got an edge from

21
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,819
four to two, from to two to three, three
to two and so forth and if we execute this

22
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:18,199
sample client, we get the edges printed
out. it builds the graph and then prints

23
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,502
out the edges. By the way, the order in
which they come out is in order of vertex

24
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:28,990
and order in which the judge comes out
depends on the representation just these

25
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:35,665
four graphs. we'll skip through the
possibilities of keeping a list of edges,

26
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:42,617
or using a matrix for, diagr aphs, cause
again. impractical problems, the graphs

27
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:50,248
are huge and sparse, so the average vertex
degree in-degree and out-degree is low. We

28
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:57,710
can't afford, to, keep space proportional
to the number of possible vertices, that a

29
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:05,811
vertex can connect to for each vertex. so,
it's very similar to or exactly the same,

30
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:10,765
really, to the one that we use for
undirected graphs. We keep a vertex

31
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:16,651
indexed array. Where, for each vertex, we
can keep a bag of all the vertices that

32
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:22,825
you can get to from that vertex. So vertex
six, has out degree four. And there's four

33
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:28,280
vertices on its list. Nine, four, eight,
and zero. And when we process the graph,

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,932
we're gonna visit those vertices, in that
order. Which is just determined by the

35
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:41,850
order in which they appeared in the input.
So here's the implementation that we used

36
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,809
for un-directed graphs last time. and
you'll see that the only difference for

37
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:55,443
die graphs is we change graph to die graph
and we only have one representation of

38
00:03:55,443 --> 00:04:01,430
each edge, V goes to W. for undirected
graphs we had W goes to V as well,

39
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,227
otherwise the code's exactly the same, we
have an iterator for the vertices adjacent

40
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:13,840
to V but that. It's the difference between
directed graphs and undirected graphs. so

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,605
again the reason we do that is that we can
get basic graph processing processed in a

42
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:28,409
reasonable amount of time. Where every
time we deal with a vertex we can get to

43
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:35,214
its neighbors are the places you can get
to from that vertex in time proportional

44
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:41,217
to the number of vertices. You simply
can't afford to do that with other

45
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:47,763
representations. So that's the digraph
API. Which is virtually identical to the

46
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:48,580
graph API.
