00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,168
.
Today, we're gonna talk about minimum

2
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:10,263
spanning trees.
This is a terrific topic for this course,

3
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:16,372
because it combines a number of classic
algorithms with modern data structures to

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:21,995
solve a variety of huge problems that are
important in practical applications

5
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:25,633
nowadays.
We'll start with a brief introduction.

6
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:31,218
What is a minimal spanning tree?
Well it's a defined on a graph Now we

7
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:37,245
generalized the idea of a graph one more
time to allow weights on the edges, so

8
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:41,361
these are positive numbers associated with
each edge.

9
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:47,240
And let say the graph is connected, so we
have a connected graph with weighted

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,632
edges, Now a spanning tree of a graph.
Is a subgraph that is connected and has no

11
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:58,322
cycles.
So, out of all the spanning trees, we want

12
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:05,201
to find one that has minimum wait.
So, that's not a spanning tree, cause it's

13
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:09,617
not connected.
This set of black edges is not a spanning

14
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:14,661
tree cause it's not a cyclic.
But here's one that is a spanning tree.

15
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:23,542
And if you add up the weights of all the
edges, four+6+8+5+11+9+7 that's 50.

16
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:29,439
And you could see, maybe you could get
another spanning tree by removing this

17
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,773
edge and adding that edge that'd have
slightly higher weight.

18
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:38,320
And so the goal is to find a spanning tree
of minimum weight.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,742
Now, there is a bird force algorithm that
is impractical, impractical and probably

20
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:50,380
would be difficult even to growth up.
And that is, let's try all possible

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,163
spanning trees.
Now, certainly, we wanna do better than

22
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:57,586
that.
Here are some examples of some huge

23
00:01:57,586 --> 00:02:03,326
spanning trees that are being worked on in
practice nowadays.

24
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:09,459
This is a bicycle route's in Seattle.
And it kind of gives a quick way from

25
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,840
downtown out to the suburbs.
You can see.

26
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:18,086
This is, the idea of an MST as a model of
natural phenomenon.

27
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:24,605
And there are many observed natural
phenomenon that, seem to be well modeled

28
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:28,421
by spanning trees.
This is a purely random graph.

29
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,793
And, a minimal spanning tree of that
random graph.

30
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:39,948
And this is, the, a image that came up in
cancer research, having to do with the

31
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:47,977
arrangement of nuclei and epithelium.
And you can see that this tree that's

32
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:55,224
observed in nature is quite similar in
character to the MSD of the random graph,

33
00:02:55,224 --> 00:03:01,168
so that's another example.
This is an example from image processing.

34
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:08,171
A process known as dithering, to remove
fuzziness in medical and other images.

35
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:14,522
In computing the MSD of a huge graph built
from such images is yet another

36
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:18,839
application.
So it's, bottom line for this introduction

37
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:23,918
is, MST is easily defined.
It's the, minimum weight set of edges that

38
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,910
now connect the vertices in a way to
graph.

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:34,512
And its got the verse applications from
dithering, and face verification, to road

40
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:41,745
networks and satellite imagery, to
ethernet networks into network designs of

41
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:48,884
all kind, and it goes back a long way, to
the, even early twentieth century for

42
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:55,838
electrical and hydraulic networks, So
that's an introduction to the idea of a

43
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,600
minimum spanning tree.
