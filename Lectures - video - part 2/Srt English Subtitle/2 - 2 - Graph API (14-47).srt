1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,801
.
As we'll see, in little bit later in the

2
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:13,177
lecture the way that we're going to set up
our graph processing algorithms, is to

3
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:19,018
develop an API to cover our representation
of the graph and provide simple set of

4
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:22,271
methods for clients to call to process the
graph.

5
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:28,991
So, let's take a look at that in detail.
So, the idea is we have to represent, a,

6
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,214
graph within the computer.
One of the first things, to remember is

7
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:40,380
that, you can, draw a graph, that maybe,
that provides some kind of intuition,

8
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:45,748
about the structure, an, but you could
have two drawings that represent,

9
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:49,520
represent the same graph that look pretty
different.

10
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:55,414
And so one of the things to remember in
any graph representation is, it can give

11
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:59,459
you some intuition.
But that intuition may be misleading.

12
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:04,600
And we'll just remember that as we look at
different representations.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,450
So first thing is how to represent the
vertices.

14
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:15,120
So what we're going to do in this lecture
is just use integers between zero and V

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,932
minus one.
The reason we do that is it allows us, to

16
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:23,776
use vertex indexed arrays, within the
graph representation.

17
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:29,494
And we understand, from earlier
algorithms, lectures, that we can use a

18
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:34,674
symbol table to convert names to integers,
with a symbol table.

19
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:40,104
And so, we'll, leave that part as a symbol
table application.

20
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:46,173
And, just work with graphs with vertex
names between zero and V minus one where v

21
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:51,692
is the number of vertices.
Now we have to remember when we're doing

22
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:56,700
representation we can have various
anomalies in the graph.

23
00:01:56,935 --> 00:02:03,351
So we can we draw edges, but actually, in
real data we might have multiple edges or

24
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:09,064
we might have a self loop.
And we'll take that into account when we

25
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:12,820
look at the representation, graph
representation.

26
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,027
So here is the API that we're going to
use.

27
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:21,546
So again our graph processing algorithms
are going to be clients of this API.

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,499
The idea is that will use this to build
graphs.

29
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:30,496
And then our processing programs will be
client at this program,

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,493
In this, of this API.
And the idea is most of them have a very

31
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:41,833
simple operations that they need to do,
and those are the one's that we put in the

32
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,220
API.
So we have two constructors.

33
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:48,248
One that creates an empty graph would be
vertices.

34
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:52,352
Another one that creates a graph from an
input stream.

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,812
Then the basic operation for building a
graph is just add edge, so that adds an

36
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:04,838
edge connecting two vertices, V and W.
The basic operations for processing our

37
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:09,597
graph, well there's V and E that gives a
number of edges and vertices.

38
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:14,080
But then there's an iterator that takes
the vertex's argument,

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,260
Then iterates through the vertices
adjacent to that vertex.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,456
All of our graph processing can be cast in
terms of this iterator.

41
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:33,061
So down here is an example of a client
program that prints out every edge in the

42
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:37,756
graph.
So we created an input stream, maybe with

43
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:43,108
a given final name, create a graph from
that input stream,

44
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:49,492
And we'll look at the code for that.
And then the client program for every

45
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:53,276
vertex,
So remember the vertices are numbered

46
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:57,467
between zero and G dot the number of
vertices minus one.

47
00:03:57,468 --> 00:04:04,058
So for every vertex, we iterate through
all the vertices adjacent to that vertex

48
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:11,420
and print out an edge, if, if there's an
edge connecting v and w we print out v and

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,805
then a little dash to indicate an edge and
then w.

50
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:22,618
This actually prints out every edge twice
and in an undirected graph because if the

51
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:28,570
v and w are connected by an edge then w
appears in v's adjacency list and v

52
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,707
appears in w's adjacency list.
So heres an example of a running that

53
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:41,938
client, if, if we have a file tinyG.txt,
our standard is we have a number of

54
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:48,137
vertices as an integer in the first is the
first integer in the file.

55
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:55,110
Number of edges is the second integer in
the file and then pairs of vertex names.

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,626
And so.
The constructor will read those two things

57
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:07,271
and then call that edge for all of these
pairs of things and that enables this

58
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:12,737
client, to, if we run it for that graph,
to print out all the edges.

59
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:19,128
So everybody adjacent to zero, 61 and
five, everybody adjacent to one is just

60
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:24,008
zero, So you notice the edge 0-1 appears
twice in the list.

61
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:28,550
So that's the sample client of our basic
graph in API.

62
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,853
And so here's some typical and simpicle,
simple graph processing code that uses the

63
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:40,039
API.
So you can write a static method that

64
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,768
takes a graph and a vertex as argument.
And returns the degree, the number of

65
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:53,580
edges that are connect, number of vertices
that are connected by an edge to V.

66
00:05:53,806 --> 00:06:00,454
So all it does is set a local variable
degree to zero, And then iterate through

67
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:05,290
all the vertices adjacent to V and
increment that and return it.

68
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,067
Similarly, you can compute the maximum
degree of a vertex in a graph.

69
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:17,779
And that's for every vertex, compute the
degree and find the biggest one or the

70
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,197
average degree.
Well, the average degree, if you think

71
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:28,381
about it, it's just twice the number of
edges divided by the vertex or you could

72
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:33,928
go through all the way through every
vertex and edge and compute the total and

73
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:39,545
divide, but this is probably a much more
efficient way to do it or say number of

74
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:45,232
self loops. and so that involves going
through the whole graph of every vertex

75
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:51,621
for every edge adjacent to that vertex you
check whether it's v and we've got a self

76
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:56,045
loop.
And if it does then your return the number

77
00:06:56,045 --> 00:07:00,960
of self loops that divided by two because
every edge is counted twice.

78
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,158
So those are examples of static methods
that a client might use.

79
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:13,958
In just example of the use of the ATI.
So now how we going to implement that?

80
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:20,067
That's our usual standard of lets look at
some clients and now let's talk about a

81
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:24,510
representation that we can use to
implement the graph API.

82
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,626
So one possible representation is, set of
edges representation, where, for every

83
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:36,815
edge, we just maintain a list, maybe an
array of edges or a linked list, of edges.

84
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:42,568
So for every edge in the graph, there's, a
representation of it.

85
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:48,320
And that one is a possible representation,
but it leads to, inefficient,

86
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:55,092
implementation, much less efficient, that
would make it unusable for, the huge

87
00:07:55,092 --> 00:08:01,263
graphs that we see in practice.
Another one is called the adjacency matrix

88
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:06,423
representation,
Here we maintain a 2-dimensional v x v

89
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:10,426
array,
It's a boolean array, 0-1 or true or

90
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:16,168
false.
And for every edge v-w in the graph you

91
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:22,930
put true for row v in column w and for row
w in column v.

92
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:30,251
So it's actually two representations of
each edge in an adjacency matrix graph

93
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:35,187
representation.
S, you can immediately, give a v and w

94
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:39,688
test whether there's an edge connecting v
and w.

95
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:47,470
But that's one of the few operations
that's efficient with this representation

96
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:54,596
and it's not very widely used, because for
a huge graph, say with billions of, of,

97
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:58,581
vertices,
You would have to have billion squared

98
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:04,489
number of entries in this array, which is
going to be too big for your computer,

99
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:08,527
most likely.
So this one actually isn't that widely

100
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,566
used.
A, The one that is most widely used in

101
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:15,699
practice, and the one that we'll stick
with, is called the adjacency list

102
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:20,778
representation.
And that's where we keep a vertex index

103
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:28,849
array where, for every vertex, we maintain
a list of the vertices that are adjacent

104
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:33,589
to that.
So, for example, vertex four, Has, five,

105
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:39,184
is connected to five, six, and three, so
its list has five, six, and three on it.

106
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:44,982
Now, on lower level representations we've
talk about using linked width or array for

107
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:48,893
these,
But actually in modern lingo with the

108
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:54,761
background that we'd built with algorisms
what we're going to use is an abstract

109
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,742
data type.
Our bag representation for this, which is

110
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:04,190
implemented with a linked list, but we
don't have to think about it when we're

111
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,540
talking about graphs. we'd keep the
vertices,

112
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:14,107
Names of, numbers of the vertices that are
adjacent to each given vertex in a bag.

113
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:19,440
And we know that we can implement it, such
that we can iterate through and time

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,678
proportional to the number of entries and
the space taken is also proportional to

115
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,703
the number of entries,,
And that's going to enable us to process

116
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:35,751
huge graphs.
So here's the full implementation of the

117
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:40,697
Jason C,
List graph representation.

118
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:49,190
So, the private instance variables that
we're gonna use area the number of

119
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:57,236
vertices in the graph and then a array of
nags of integers. so data the types and

120
00:10:57,236 --> 00:11:03,911
set of values, set operations on those
values, so those are the sets of values

121
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:09,084
for a graph.
So here's the constructor of an empty

122
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:15,807
graph with V vertices.
We keep the value v in the instance

123
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,850
variable as usual.
Then we create.

124
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,979
An array of size V.
And, of bags of integers.

125
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:31,969
And, store that array in, [inaudible] as
the adjacency array of the graph.

126
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:36,527
Adjacency lists array.
And then, as usual.

127
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:42,395
When we create, a, a, an array of objects.
We go through.

128
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:49,954
And for every entry in the array, we
initialize with, a, empty object.

129
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:54,430
So, after this code, we have the empty
bags.

130
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:02,557
And so that's the constructor and then the
other main engine and building graphs is

131
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:09,963
at edge and so, to add an edge between V
and W, we add W to V's bag, and we add V

132
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,860
to W's bag.
That's it.

133
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:19,583
And to iterate through all the vertices
adjacent to a given vertex we simply

134
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:26,184
return the bag which is iterable.
This is a nice example, illustrating the

135
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:30,934
power of abstraction.
Because we did the low level processing,

136
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:37,021
for, that, that's involved, with our bag
implementation in one of the early,

137
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:41,103
lectures.
And now we, we get to use that to give a

138
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:47,116
very compact implementation, and efficient
implementation, of the, graph data

139
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,753
structure.
So it's really important to understand

140
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:54,687
this code.
And you should make sure, that you study

141
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,234
it.
So, as I mentioned in practice.

142
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:01,391
We're gonna be using this adjacency list
representation.

143
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:07,379
Because all the algorithms are based on
iterating over the vertices adjacent to V.

144
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,099
And this gets that done in time
proportional to the number of such

145
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,904
vertices.
So that's number one and number two, in

146
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:20,412
the real world, the graphs have lots of
num, lots of vertices,

147
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:27,901
But a pretty small vertex degre. so number
one, we can afford to represent, represent

148
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:34,262
the graph when we use the adjacency list
representation because basically our space

149
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:40,258
is proportional to the number of edges.
And number two, we can afford to process

150
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:46,619
it because our time taken is proportional
to the number of edges that, that we

151
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:52,176
examined, with the ray of edges
representation in the adjacency matrix

152
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:57,062
representation it gets very slow for some
very simple task,

153
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:03,080
But, mostly, it's very slow for iterating
over the vertices given to, adjacent to a

154
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,055
given vertex.
Which is the key operation.

155
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:11,936
A list of edges, you have to go through
all the edges to find the ones adjacent to

156
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:15,741
a given vertex.
Adjacency matrix, you have to go through,

157
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:21,206
all possible, vertices adjacent and that's
just going to be much too slow in

158
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:24,734
practice,
Because adjacency list gets it done, in

159
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:30,879
time proportional degree of v, which is
much smaller, for the huge graph that we

160
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,682
see in the real world.
So that's our basic API.

161
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:39,760
Next, we'll look at some algorithms that
are clients of this API.
