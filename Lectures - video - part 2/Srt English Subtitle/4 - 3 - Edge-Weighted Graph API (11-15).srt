1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:10,484
So, before we can develop code for our
implementations we need to settle on an

2
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:16,029
API for edge weighted graphs.
Now this actually needs a bit of

3
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:21,072
discussion.
It would seem to be simple to add weights.

4
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:27,397
But there's a few technicalities that it's
easy to understand.

5
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:31,414
But it's going to take a little
explanation.

6
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:36,030
So, the whole idea is that we need an edge
abstraction.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,167
Before for directed graphs, undirected
graphs, we're talking about graphs in

8
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,720
terms of connections, and the edges were
really implicit.

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,863
So, for a vertex, we would keep a bag of
vertices that its connected to but we

10
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:57,084
wouldn't explicitly represent edges.
For weighted edges, we're going to need to

11
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:01,615
do that.
So we're going to start out with an the

12
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:07,701
just for processing edges.
Now, it's simple. The constructor is just

13
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:12,305
going to create an edge.
So, what is an edge?

14
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:19,337
A weighted edge is two vertices that they
connect, that, it connects and then a

15
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:25,919
double value, which is the weight.
So that's clearly one thing we have to do

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,728
is, is construct the edge.
Now what do we want to do when we process

17
00:01:31,728 --> 00:00:28,425
edges?
Well, one thing we want to do is compare

18
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:42,310
two edges, so that is, we want to compare
the weights in, in a typical compare and

19
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:49,472
return a negative value of less than zero
if equal and a positive value of one just

20
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:55,069
like any other compare.
So we have one the method that takes an

21
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,005
edge as argument and compares that edge to
this edge for sure.

22
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:05,496
We want to be able to extract the weight
and have a string representation of the

23
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:08,902
edge.
But then, what about getting the vertices

24
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:12,586
out of the edge?
Well, the fact is that the, usually in

25
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,270
the, in the algorithm, we're holding on,
to a vertex.

26
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,302
And generally, what we want to do is get
the other vertex.

27
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,677
So, if we have a vertex v that we're
holding on to, what we want is the other

28
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:30,057
vertex.
So well that's the way that will get the

29
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:35,324
vertex to that a given edge.
We're on a vertex and we have an edge we

30
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:39,961
want to get the edge that, that, the
vertex that, that connects to,

31
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:45,287
We just call the other method.
And if we have an idiom, we're just

32
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:50,034
getting started then, then we are happy to
take either vertex.

33
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:56,562
So we have either and other for getting
the vertices out of the edges and we

34
00:02:56,562 --> 00:03:02,994
almost always do this kind of idiom where
we pick out and we, we have an edge e that

35
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:06,957
we have to process.
We pick out either edge, and we put that

36
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,770
in v,
And we pick out the other edge, and put

37
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,720
that in w.
So that's just a, a code for getting us

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,241
the v and w without adopting some
convention on how to use those names that

39
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:32,054
might be required if you tried to access
the instance variables directly or through

40
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:36,090
gutter methods.
So, that's the edge API.

41
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,454
So it's easy to implement.
So, now we're going to have instance

42
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:48,001
variables for v and w in the weight.
The constructor just sets those instance

43
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:53,129
variables.
Either just returns v arbitrarily ag, then

44
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,282
other, given a vertex that vertex is v, V
or returns w, otherwise, it turns v, so

45
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:03,621
that's easy.
And then, compared to is straightforward,

46
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:10,991
just using the weight instance variable of
this, which is the keyword referring to

47
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:16,234
this object and that which is the argument
edge that we're given.

48
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:22,689
So, that's a complete implementation of
the weighted edge API and now our MST

49
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:30,164
algorithms can be clients of that.
So well first, first we need a graph API

50
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:35,594
that has weighted edges.
So we're going to use edge-weighted graph.

51
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,418
And it's going to have the same
characteristics of the graph and

52
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:46,062
undirected graph API that we articulated
before.

53
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:52,673
So we're going to create empty graph with
a certain number of vertices and we do

54
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:57,946
that so we can use vertex index arrays as
internal data structures.

55
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:06,060
We'll have a created a weighted graph from
an input stream then the main operation to

56
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,460
build graphs is just to add edges.
And then the key operation that all the

57
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,420
algorithms want to perform as usual is
uniterable but give all the edges adjacent

58
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,300
to a given vertex.
So now, we want the edges themselves cuz

59
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,500
they have the weights.
Not just the vertex that it's connected

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,780
to.
So, this, with the edge API, the edge

61
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,670
abstraction we get the edge, which gives
us the weight and the other vertex at the

62
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,110
same time.
Since we're using edges as distinct

63
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,812
entities it's easy to allow self loops in
parallel edges in the graph API and it

64
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:55,132
doesn't have any impact on the MST
algorithms.

65
00:05:55,132 --> 00:06:02,317
So, we'll go ahead and do that.
How do we represent edge-weighted graphs?

66
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:10,731
I, well, it's the straightforward
extension of what we did for undirected

67
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,951
graphs.
We're going to maintain a vertex index

68
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:26,785
array of edge lists.
So for every vertex we have a list of the

69
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:36,037
edges connected to that vertex.
For example in this graph weighted graph,

70
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:43,219
there is an edge the ones connected to
vertex zero, or an edge that connects and

71
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:48,653
six and zero and has a weight 0.58 and an
edge that connects two and zero and has

72
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:53,929
0.26, zero and four has 0.38, zero and
seven has 0.16. As with our undirected

73
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:58,969
graph representations each edge object is
going to appear twice.

74
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:05,268
Once for each vertex that it connects.
And it's actually not an object, it's a

75
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:11,838
reference to an object in Java.
So, a graph is a vertex index array of

76
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:17,755
bags of edges.
Since it's undirected each edge is going

77
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:23,222
to appear twice.
So, when we build a graph just as with

78
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:30,552
undirected unweighted graphs we have to
add,, If, if we have an edge that connects

79
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:36,013
v and w we have to add that edge to both v
and w's adjacency list.

80
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,000
Otherwise it's quite similar to R code for
graph.

81
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:47,411
We have a bag of edges instead of a bag of
integers, which were vertex indices.

82
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:54,898
Constructor builds the bag.
And builds the array and then fills the

83
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:59,600
bag associated, associated with each
vertex as a new empty bag.

84
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:04,682
And then add, add edge, adds the edge to
both v and w's bag.

85
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,750
And interval just returns the bag
associated with the given vertex and

86
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,846
that's all the edges that are incident on
that vertex.

87
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:20,763
And that's a bag which is interval.
So, again, as for all the algorithms that

88
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:25,390
we've been looking at, the clients will
just iterate.

89
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,991
Usually, you have a vertex, and it'll
iterate through the edges adjacent to that

90
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:35,458
vertex.
So that's the representation of the graph.

91
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:41,239
What about representing the MST?
Well, usually the client of an MST

92
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:49,003
algorithm is going to want to have us
compute the MST for a given edge-weighted

93
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:53,370
graph.
So, we'll just do that in a class named

94
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,765
MST and make that the constructor.
So then, as usual, in our graph processing

95
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,239
paradigm, the constructor will do all the
work.

96
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:07,921
And then the client can ask queries about
what happened.

97
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,905
And in this case, what's relevant is, what
are the edges in the MST?

98
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:17,964
And the MST client is just going to want
to iterate through those edges.

99
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,005
It might also want the total weight of the
MST, so we can provide that, too.

100
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:31,145
So for example if we take a, an example
with our tiny edge-weighted graph,

101
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:38,263
We're going to have the number of
vertices, the number of edges and then, a

102
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:46,184
list of vertex pairs, which are the edge
connections and the associated weights.

103
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:53,432
Ahm the what we'll want is the this is the
test client is just going to print the

104
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:59,963
edges in the MST the middle-weight edges
that connect them all instead the edges on

105
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:05,561
MST and the weight.
And this is the code for that test client.

106
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:13,404
So we build an input stream which is given
the argument, so that's the filename. and

107
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:21,060
then, we use the constructor from the
stream to build an edge-weighted graph.

108
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,775
Then we do an MST calling the MST
constructor with that graph is an argument

109
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:33,440
that creates an MST.
And then, we use the iterator.

110
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:41,080
That mst.edges will give us some interval
set of the edges that are in the MST that

111
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,829
it computed in the constructor.
And it will print out the edges using

112
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:51,240
two-string for edge and then print out the
weight.

113
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,147
So that's the code that gives the test
client for this MST API.

114
00:10:57,147 --> 00:11:01,480
So, for that graph, we get that output
with that code.

115
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:08,200
So, that's a, the quick introduction to
the API, APIs we use for MSTs.
