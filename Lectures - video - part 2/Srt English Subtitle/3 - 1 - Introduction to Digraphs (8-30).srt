1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,155
Today, we're, we're going to look at the
vector graphs, which is another graph

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:11,636
processing model that's very useful in
many applications.

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:17,010
It's very similar to the undirected grpah
model that we looked at last time, but

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,636
there are some really profound
differences.

5
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:24,705
After introducing the concept and looking
at the API, we'll look at three important

6
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:28,125
classic algorithms for processing directed
graphs.

7
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,400
The intro, introduction has to deal with
just explaining the concept and seeing

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,941
what it does to our graph processing
problems like the ones that we talked

9
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:42,570
about for undirected graphs last time.
So, the idea isn't that the edges now have

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,987
direction.
A directed graph or a digraph is a set of

11
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:51,508
vertices that are connected pairwise by
directed edges.

12
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:57,427
So, it's list of pairs of vertices where
the order of the pair matters.

13
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:03,345
So, an edge we say an edge goes from one
vertex to another one. whereas, in

14
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:07,538
undirected graphs, we just talked about
connections.

15
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:13,330
When we're processing such graphs or
travelling around them, we have to follow

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,892
edges in the given direction.
So, for example, if we talk about a path

17
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:22,877
in the diagram there's, it looks like
there's a connection between two and zero,

18
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:27,068
but it only goes from two to zero.
If you want to go from zero to two, you

19
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:31,730
have to follow the edges in direction
going from zero to five to four and then

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,390
to two.
In the directed graph, in this digraph you

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,257
can see two directly from zero.
Similarly, a directed cycle follows the

22
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:46,550
edges around the direction to get back to
the original vertex. also vertices have

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,757
in-degree and out-degree in digraphs.
And the out-degree, obviously, is the

24
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:57,109
number of variables leaving the vertex and
in the in-degree is the number of

25
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,678
variables coming into the vertex.
Those are the basic definitions. let's

26
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:08,819
look at a couple of applications one
obvious one is road networks where we put

27
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,815
a vertex according to intersection in an
edge for roads.

28
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:18,524
And we look at a situation where most,
where the roads are one way or can be one

29
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:21,592
way.
So, if you've driven in lower Manhattan,

30
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:26,516
you're very familiar with this map, which
has lots of one-way streets.

31
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:31,012
And it's not always clear how to get from
one place to another.

32
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:35,793
You can have some two-way streets that
have edges in both directions.

33
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:40,289
But with digraphs, we allow the
abstraction of one-way streets.

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:01:11,162
Here's another more abstract example.
This is the political blogosphere with

35
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:50,008
connections.
If, If blogs have links to one another as

36
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:55,050
you can see, most of the links go from
blue to blue or from red to red.

37
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:01,101
Although there are some orange links that
go from blue to red and a few purple ones

38
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:07,008
that go from red to blue.
And this gives some insight to the in the

39
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:11,670
political blogosphere at least in 2004.
Here's another one.

40
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:19,320
This is a study of the crash in 2008, and
it was a graph that showed the structure

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,160
of banks lending to one another.
An edge corresponds from an overnight loan

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,480
and a vertex corresponds to the bank.
And from studying this diagram, experts

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,960
can see how the banks divided into groups
and were therefore vulnerable in these

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,960
groups and we'll look at a more detailed
definitions of how these groups are

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,240
defined a little later on.
This is just an example of the use of a

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,820
digraph.
And it's a digraph, the bank.

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,898
One bank lends money to another, that's
not the same as the banks being connected,

48
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:59,910
in some as in an undirected graph.
The direction really matters.

49
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:07,274
This is another one from logic where the
vertices correspond to Boolean variables

50
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:13,619
and the edges correspond to implication.
And people use graphs like this to study

51
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:18,868
in, in logical verification, and also
studying electric circuits.

52
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:24,900
Electric circuits themselves can be
diagraphs where circuit elements have

53
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,287
input and output.
And so, the edge of course takes the

54
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:32,891
output of one element to the input of
another.

55
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:39,240
Trying to understand the behavior of such
a circuit involves processing a digraph.

56
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:43,830
Here's another abstraction so-called
wordnet graph.

57
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:50,568
Where vertices correspond in what is
called synsets and edges correspond to

58
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:56,046
hypernym relationships where a, a word is
an instance of another one.

59
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:02,635
So, there's a lot of different events like
a miracle or human activity and so forth.

60
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:09,233
And graphs of this type are very useful in
studying applications involving meanings,

61
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,829
meanings in human languages.
Here's a famous one.

62
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:19,355
General McChrystal said that once we
understand this graph the war in

63
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:24,469
Afghanistan will be over.
So, with all these types of applications

64
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:28,967
and there's many, many others just as with
graph processing.

65
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:34,761
Now, the digraph as it, as it is modeled
distinct from graph processing is

66
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:39,183
important.
There's many direct applications where we

67
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:45,740
have connections between objects but the
direction of the connection matters.

68
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,191
So, what about digraph processing
algorithms.

69
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:54,384
Well, we're going to look at many problems
that are very similar to the ones that we

70
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:58,959
looked at for undirected graphs.
But you can see that they are going to be

71
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,100
a bit more complicated.
Even a human has trouble looking at a

72
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,231
diagraph trying to figure out a simple
problem like, is there a path from s to t

73
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:11,693
in this, in this diagraph.
Seems like there's quite a few

74
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:17,010
possibilities to consider to convince
yourself whether or not there's a path.

75
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:22,953
And for the huge diagraphs examples that I
looked at before obviously we're going to

76
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:27,078
need a computer program.
And we're going to have a bit of a

77
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:31,868
challenge figuring what's going on.
Of course, you might want to know the

78
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:37,324
shortest directed path from s to t for
example, if you are driving around lower

79
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:41,716
Manhattan and certainly, I want to have a
solution to that problem.

80
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:46,972
Then, there's another problem called the
topological sort problem which is a

81
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:52,228
general model that's useful in all kinds
of applications where were scheduling

82
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,090
events that involve precedence
constraints.

83
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,363
In the graph obstruction or the digraph
obstruction, it amounts to the problem of

84
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:04,450
trying to draw the digraph so that all the
edges point up.

85
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,781
That's called topological sorting.
And then, connectivity is more complicated

86
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:15,350
for digraphs than for undirected graphs.
There's the concept of strong

87
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,636
connectivity, which means for any given
pair of vertices u and v, you want to know

88
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:28,160
is there going to be a directed path from
u to v and another directed path from v to

89
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,422
u.
That's a much more complicated problem

90
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:38,012
than connectivity in undirected graphs.
And, a generalization of, of that or a

91
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:43,076
query related to strong connectivities,
so-called transitive closure.

92
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:49,108
And for that, you just want to be able
answer the query given vertices v and w as

93
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:52,460
their path from w to v, a transitive
closure.

94
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:58,813
And actually, you're familiar with the web
is a gigantic directed graph.

95
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,615
If there's a link from page a to page b,
B, that's a directed edge.

96
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:11,798
And digraph processing is used in famous
page rank algorithm to determine the

97
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:17,691
importance of a web page.
Those are just a couple of examples of

98
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:22,480
digraph processing problems that introduce
the idea.
