1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,525
Now, we'll look at an algorithm for
solving the linear programming problem and

2
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:16,437
leaves the brewer's problem as an example.
this algorithm was developed by George

3
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:22,824
Dantzig right after World War II. and it,
it was in response to a very important

4
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:30,257
practical problem which was the logistics
of the Berlin airlift. and again, scarce

5
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:36,675
resources and particular constraints and
you want to maximize an objective

6
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:43,490
function. and this algorithm that was
developed by Dantzig again, is very, very

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,226
widely used today and certainly one of the
top ten scientific algorithms ever, I'd

8
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:56,724
say. so, it's a very simple generic idea.
we're going to start at some extreme

9
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:02,250
point. And then, we're going to perform
this operation called pivoting that moves

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,786
us from one extreme point to an ad, an
adjacent one that at least doesn't

11
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:13,289
increase the object, doesn't decrease the
objective function. And we just keep going

12
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:18,658
until we get stuck where there's an
extreme point that is not better than any

13
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:24,828
of its adjacent ones. and then we have an
optimal solution. so, in our brewer's

14
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:29,807
problem we start at the origin and just,
you know, simply move from one extreme

15
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:36,439
point to the other until we find an
optimal solution. and what's remarkable is

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,538
that really Linear Algebra sets us up to
do this solution. if you're familiar with

17
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:52,370
solving simultaneous equations this uses
the same basic idea. the difference is

18
00:01:52,370 --> 00:02:00,469
that we've got many more unknowns and
equations usually certainly not an equal

19
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:07,528
number and so we have to take care of that
situation and also, we have the objective

20
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:15,318
function playing a role. so but still, the
basic idea is to get it down to solving

21
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:23,790
simultaneous equations. so, there's first
the idea of a basis, that's just a subset

22
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,158
of the variables. and, so, we pick a
subset of the variables. and then we're

23
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:39,469
always going to be working with something
called a basic feasible solution. so the

24
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:46,499
idea is you have a subset of the
variables. so let's say, that's M in this

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:55,107
case. there's three variables in the
basis. and the idea is that you set the

26
00:02:55,107 --> 00:03:05,044
other variables to zero. so now, you've
got M equations and M unknowns cuz you,

27
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:12,903
you just set M minus N to zero. and so,
that gives you values for your basis. and

28
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:22,842
the idea is that a basic feasible solution
corresponds to an extreme point on the

29
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:29,420
simplex. so, for example, if all the
flacks, slack variables are in the basis

30
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,699
and that, we set the others to zero, we
set A and B to zero. then, that's what

31
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:45,031
that says, that's the value of A and B
when the slack variables are all in the

32
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:54,336
basis. if B is in the basis and, and HS
and HM are in the basis then B is zero and

33
00:03:54,336 --> 00:04:00,916
then, if you solve for the three
equations, you get that A is 32 and so

34
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:09,942
forth. So basic feasible solution is if
you have M constraints it's a subset of

35
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:16,072
size M, so that you have an M by M system
equation to solve assuming the others to

36
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:22,054
be zero. and for the algorithm so it's
called the simplex algorithm, because this

37
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:27,183
thing that's the intersection of the half
plane, it's just called a simplex And it's

38
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,197
going to move along the simplex with, it's
basic feasible solutions, are extreme

39
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:36,750
points on the simplex. And the simplex
algorithm is going to move along from one

40
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,156
point to another. now, there's some
solutions that are infeasible that are not

41
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:48,132
on the simplex. if it's, it says, if it's
unique and feasible, it's a basic feasible

42
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:53,813
solution. It could be like if you pit A,
B, and S sub H to be in your basis, you

43
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:59,420
set the other ones to zero it's, it's not
feasible, it's outside of the simplex. So,

44
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,449
we won't even consider those. okay. So,
so, so to get things started what we need

45
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:13,447
to do is initialize. And I'll initialize
in that case, at the origin, when A and B

46
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:20,276
are equal to zero. and these three slack
variables are the basis. and then the

47
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:27,189
solution is really easy in that case.
here's our equations. we set A and B to

48
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:33,681
zero, so that cancels out all of that
stuff. So, that tells us the values of SC,

49
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:42,455
SH and SM in, in that case. so, that's
easy to solve in that case. so one basic

50
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:48,545
variable per row this started as the basis
at and since they are non-basic variables

51
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:54,879
to zero to solve three equations to get
the answer, you don 't have to do any work

52
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,482
for that. So, that's how we initialize
things from that. you can initialize right

53
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:07,303
from the constraints of the problem. All
that's in here is our recipe for ale and

54
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:13,494
our recipe for beer and our profit margins
for the two different drinks. okay. So now

55
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:19,868
it starts to get interesting. And we're
going to perform an operation called a

56
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:26,758
pivot. and we'll talk about how to choose
the pivot in a minute. So right now, let's

57
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:33,649
say, we're going to choose to pivot on
this entry right here. What that means is,

58
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:40,569
what we're going to do just as you do in
Gaussian elimination you're going to pick

59
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,660
this element and then you're going to
solve for that variable. and then

60
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:53,164
substitute that solution into all the
other equations so that these entries

61
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:59,924
become zero. So, we solve for B equals,
you take 480 minus five, A minus SC divide

62
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:04,080
by fifteen.
This equation says that's what B is.

63
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,128
Substitute it in these other equations and
that puts B into the basis and takes some

64
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:19,467
other variable out. and at the start, you
just might think about how do you figure

65
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:28,120
out which variable it replaces. if we do
the math here here's what the system of

66
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,268
equation looks like. so that's just
substituting B into the other equations,

67
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:43,332
including the objective function. and now
our basis is B, SH, and SM. A and FC are,

68
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:51,305
are zero and our objective function says,
that Z equals 36, 736. So, that's called a

69
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:58,024
pivot. it picked a variable substitute
into the other equations puts it into the

70
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:04,233
basis and makes the other entries in this
column zero. so, why choose that

71
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:11,862
particular variable? well look at the
objective function and its coefficient is

72
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:19,131
positive, so if we B is sitting at zero.
And if we increase it to some positive

73
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:25,929
number, we're going to increase our
objective function. so, as long as the

74
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:33,481
coefficient objective function is
positive, that tells us the column. We can

75
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:41,391
also do it on A in this case and then Y,
that row. well you have to make sure that

76
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:48,139
the right-hand side always stays bigger
than zero. and so, what uses to choose the

77
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:53,608
row is the minimum ratio rule. So, if you
ta ke the right-hand side over the

78
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:58,936
coefficient, you want the one that's
smallest because when you do the

79
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:05,281
substitution that will make sure that the
right-hand side is positive. so that's the

80
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:11,101
choice of the pivots. So now, we're in
this situation and we just do the same

81
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:17,304
thing. So we want to look for something
that's got a positive coefficient in the

82
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:23,507
objective function. And then, we want to
do the minimum ratio rule. and that turns

83
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:31,011
out to be that we pivot on column one row
two. and we just that's 32 plus 450 SC

84
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:37,750
minus SH divided by eight thirds is three
eighths. substitute that into everything

85
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,149
and that's going to eliminate A everywhere
else and it will put see, since we're

86
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:49,547
substituting for A, A comes out of the
basis in the objective function and

87
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:55,085
something else will go in. And again,
think about what it is that goes in. and

88
00:09:55,085 --> 00:10:02,401
then we wind up in this situation here. so
that's again, just doing the math. Now,

89
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:10,477
what's interesting about having done the
math here now we don't have any positive

90
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:18,554
coefficients in the exec, in objective
function. so, these two variables are zero

91
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:25,983
now but if we take them out of the basis
and get a bigger value that's going to be

92
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:32,272
no good. so we'll stuck. And that's the
same as, same as the time that we stop

93
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:39,589
pivoting. if we to go in any direction
from where we are we're not going to do as

94
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:46,743
well. and that is optimal because first of
all any solution is going to satisfy the

95
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:53,881
current system of equations. so in
particular whatever values you give SC and

96
00:10:53,881 --> 00:11:01,186
SA, it's got to satisfy this equation but
that's going to since they're positive,

97
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:08,407
you can't do better than 800. so you might
as well just be happy when they're zero

98
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:15,053
which is where they are. so it's as simple
as that, you know? So, the current value

99
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:21,508
has 800, so it's optimal, you're not going
to do better. and so that's a, a sketch of

100
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:27,587
a simplex algorithm. It's simply a matter
of choosing a pivot element and then

101
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:34,042
pivoting and then keep going until you
can't choose a pivot element. it's really

102
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:40,461
remarkably simple when you think about it.
That's the simplex algor ithm for linear
