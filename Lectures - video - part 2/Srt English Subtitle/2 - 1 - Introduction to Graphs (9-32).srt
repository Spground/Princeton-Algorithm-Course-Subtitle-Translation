00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,324
Welcome back.
Our topic today is algorithms for

2
00:00:06,324 --> 00:00:11,774
processing undirected graphs which are a
model that are widely used for many, many

3
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:15,364
applications.
We'll see plenty of examples and then

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:20,881
we'll look at three fundamental algorithms
for processing undirected graphs and

5
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:26,065
consider some of the challenges of
developing algorithms for, for this kind

6
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:30,799
of structure.
So as introduction we'll take a look at

7
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,510
the basic ideas behind undirected graphs
and applications.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,357
What is an undirected draft?
It's the, the definition is very simple.

9
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:44,120
It's a set a verticies connected pairwise
by edges.

10
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:49,550
So this is an example of an undirected
graph that describes the Paris Metro.

11
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:55,510
You've got stations and if there's a rail
line between the stations there's an edge.

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,952
So why do we study graphs and graph
algorithms?

13
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:04,530
Well there are literally thousands of
practical applications where graphs are an

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,625
appropriate models and we'll take a look
at a few others in just a minute.

15
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:14,790
Because there are so many applications,
there's literally hundreds of graph

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,505
algorithms known and these are sometimes
quite sophisticated, as we'll see and also

17
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:25,050
very important in understanding what's
going on in an application.

18
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:30,994
Even without the applications a graph is
really an interesting and broadly useful

19
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:36,870
abstraction to try and understand that's
so simple to describe, but leads to quite

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,045
complex and difficult to understand
structures.

21
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:45,584
In a general graph theory and graph
algorithms is a very challenging branch of

22
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:50,110
computer science and discreet math that
we're just introducing now.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,772
So here's an example of a graph,
In, in genetics or in genomics,

24
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:03,547
Where if the network where the nodes are
proteins and the edges are interactions

25
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:09,305
among the proteins.
And genomicists are trying to understand

26
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:15,928
how these biological processes work.
Need to understand the nature of

27
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:20,712
connections like this.
Here's another example, the internet

28
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:27,466
itself, where, every node is a computer
and every edge is or, or a node, every, a

29
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:32,513
computer or a communications device, and
every edge is connections.

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,526
And of course, the Internet is driven by
loops and bounds, so this is a huge craft,

31
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:44,390
in this lot of needs, lot of interest
understanding, properties of this craft.

32
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:53,310
This is a, social graph having to do the
way science is carried out.

33
00:02:53,649 --> 00:03:03,511
So it's the, the nodes are and scientist
websites and the edges or, clicks

34
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:08,357
connecting one to another.
This one shows how scientists in different

35
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:12,872
fields are interacting.
And again interesting and important to

36
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:18,316
understand properties of this graph.
You're certainly familiar with Facebook.

37
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:22,100
That's one of the hugest one of the
biggest graphs.

38
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,552
It's absolutely huge,
And it's always changing.

39
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:29,470
It's very dynamic and people want to
understand its property.

40
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:34,920
This is an example of a graph, that was
used, in litigation,

41
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:41,836
Where people were trying to understand,
exactly, precisely, the communications

42
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:48,263
patterns, in a particular corporate
culture, that was of great interest to

43
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:53,043
many people.
Another similar example, this is people

44
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,530
lobbying the FCC and how are they
connected.

45
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:03,660
So from the breadth and variety of these
examples, you can see that number one.

46
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:08,814
Graphs are very general model, and number
two, graphs can be huge.

47
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:16,184
This is another one showing the Framingham
heart study and connections among people

48
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,830
in the study and how it relates to
obesity.

49
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,654
So those examples in this list shows that
it's graphs are very flexible and very

50
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:32,818
dynamic model and that the graphs involved
can be huge they could have complex

51
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:39,056
properties. And so our challenge is to try
to figure out efficient algorithms that

52
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:43,972
can give us some insight into the
structure of graphs like this.

53
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:49,770
That's what we're going to be talking
about for the rest of this lecture.

54
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:57,308
So now back to a starting point which is
we need some simple and clear and specific

55
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:01,952
definitions about basic terms that we're
talking about.

56
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:08,653
And then we'll look at algorithms that
work for a small example but also the same

57
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:14,440
algorithms do what we need for big graphs
of the type we just considered.

58
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:20,263
So this is the terminology for that we'll
use for graph processing.

59
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:26,603
So we have a vertex which is a black dot
in this graph and an edge which is black

60
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:31,763
line connecting two vertices.
And then a few more concepts that are

61
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:36,408
important in many applications.
So one is the idea of the path.

62
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,610
That's just a sequence of vertices
connected by edges.

63
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:44,764
And the idea of a cycle,
Which is a path who's first and last

64
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:48,789
vertices are the same.
So over on the left, you can see a cycle

65
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,165
of length five, that connects these five
vertices.

66
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:56,385
And wherever you start, you go back to the
same place.

67
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,023
So we say the two vertices are connected
if there's a path between them.

68
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:07,618
And then that definition leads us to the
idea of a graph dividing up into

69
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:12,382
connective components,
Which is subsets of the graph where each

70
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:17,372
pair of vertices is connected.
And, so one of the algorithms that we're

71
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:22,816
going to look at today is one for
identifying connected components in, in a

72
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,162
graph.
So that's just one example.

73
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:30,524
Here's some examples of problems that
might arise in graph processing that are

74
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,867
easily understood just given these basic
definitions.

75
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:38,724
So the very first one is given two
vertices, is there a path connecting those

76
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:42,005
two vertices?
Like in the Internet graph, you want to

77
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:45,790
know, can I get from where I am to where I
want to get?

78
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:50,632
Or maybe you want the shortest path,
The most efficient way to get between two

79
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:53,801
vertices.
You might want to know is there a cycle on

80
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:57,508
the graph?
If the graph maybe represents electrical

81
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,736
kind activity a cycle might represent a
short circuit,

82
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:05,226
You would want to check for that.
Or maybe you want to systematically go

83
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:09,431
everywhere in the graph,
So there's two related problems called the

84
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:14,076
Euler tour and the Hamilton tour.
Euler tour is, is there a cycle that uses

85
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:18,093
each edge exactly once?
Can I go look around the graph and touch

86
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:21,482
every edge in it?
And the one called the Hamilton tour,

87
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,876
which says well I'm really just interested
in getting to the vertices.

88
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,140
Is there a cycle that uses each vertex
exactly once?

89
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,143
Or basic connectivity problems.
So you want to know, is there some way to

90
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,280
connect all the vertices?
Is there a path between each pair of

91
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,084
vertices in the graph or not?
Or you might want to know what's called

92
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:48,421
the minimal spanning tree, which is the
shortest set of edges, or the best way to

93
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:53,159
connect all of the vertices.
And then various processing issues related

94
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,628
to connectivity.
For example, is there a vertex whose

95
00:07:56,628 --> 00:08:02,011
removal disconnects the graph?
Drawing the graph.

96
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:06,147
Can you draw the graph in the plane with
no edges crossing?

97
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:11,685
Some of the graph with nodes are
correspond to places in the plan or cities

98
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:15,821
on the Earth or whatever,
But some of the other graphs are very

99
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:19,396
abstract, may have nothing to do with
geometry.

100
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:24,933
You might want to know can you draw with
no crossing edges or you might have two

101
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:29,210
graphs, and a vertex named different to
represent the same graph.

102
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,577
So one of the biggest challenges in graph
processing that we'll address today in

103
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:42,260
this lecture somewhat is just to decide
how difficult are these problems.

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,078
Some of them are very easy, some of them
are very difficult and some of them,

105
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:52,151
actually, is unknown how difficult they
are.

106
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:56,628
There's such a broad variety of problems
that are simply stated.

107
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:02,774
One of the first things that we have to be
aware of when doing graph processing is

108
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:09,389
that we, we are entering into a forest of,
of all different possibilities and, and we

109
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:14,800
have to be careful that we're working on a
problem that we can solve.

110
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,477
And we'll try to give some insights into
that during the lectures that we gave on

111
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,735
graph-processing.
So that's our introduction to
