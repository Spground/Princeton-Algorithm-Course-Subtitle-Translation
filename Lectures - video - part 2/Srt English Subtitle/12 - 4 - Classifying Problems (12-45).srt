1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,964
Now, if we put the last two sections
together it gives us a way to start to

2
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:14,868
think about how to classify problems
according to their difficulty. Let's look

3
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:21,756
at how that works. so what we're always
looking for is a problem that where the

4
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:27,433
algorithm matches the, the, lower bound.
and so, one way to do that is just use

5
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:34,013
reduction. so, in order to, we want to
prove that two problems X and Y, have the

6
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:40,502
same complexity or the same research
requirements. First, we show that X linear

7
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:47,298
time reduces to Y. And then we show that Y
linear time reduces to X. and then with

8
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:53,800
that way, even if we don't know what the
complexity is at all, we know that X and Y

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,500
are, have the same computational
requirements. And this is what we just did

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,601
for sorting in convex hull. In this case,
we know that both of them take time

11
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:13,771
proportional to N log N but the reducing
one to the other in both directions shows

12
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:21,960
us their, their equivalent with respect to
computational requirements. in the one

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,933
case reducing sorting to convex hull gave
us a lower bound. In the other case,

14
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:35,073
reducing convex hull to sorting gave us a
useful algorithm. but together they're

15
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:40,928
useful because it helps classify those
problems. now, there is a bit of a caveat

16
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:47,140
to this and this is a little bit of an
idealized situation. But it actually is,

17
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:52,637
is something that can lead to trouble in
the real world. So, we have these two

18
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:57,885
problems. and we have the, these two
propositions, that they, in linear time,

19
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:03,489
reduce to one another. now, it could be
that in a big software engineering effort

20
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:09,093
there there's a lot of people making
decisions. and well, so we found out they

21
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:14,763
have the same complexity. But maybe some
system designer has a big project and

22
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:19,781
there's a lot, a lot of things, so they
need both sort and convex hull. And one

23
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:25,080
programmer is charged with a job of
implementing sort. and understands that

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,185
well, you could do that using convex hull.
I learned this cool trick. And the other

25
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:37,799
one knows the Graham scan, says, okay, I'm
going to index convex hull using sort. and

26
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:44,752
that's in a big system. and that's going
to lead to a problem. It's an infinite

27
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:51,882
reduction loop which certainly is going to
lead to problems. whose fault, well that

28
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:58,084
would be the boss. Alice and Bob just did
what they were suppose to. and it's, they

29
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:04,505
were all, somebody could argue Alice maybe
could have used a library routine for the

30
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:09,831
sort but you, you get the point for a
complex situation. this definitely could

31
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:15,876
have come up just to show the power of
this kind of technique and how it relates

32
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:21,038
to research that's still ongoing in
Computer Science. let's look at some

33
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:26,995
simple examples from Arithmetic. So here's
the grade school integer nullification.

34
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:32,025
let's do it with bits. So, I have two N
bit integers I want to compute the

35
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:37,849
product. and this is the way you learned
to do it in grade school. For every bit in

36
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:43,948
the bottom you multiply it by the top and
then you add them all together. and that's

37
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:51,351
going to take time proportional to N^2.
You have N bits and you have N rows. and

38
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:57,241
so that's time proportional to N^2.
And but now, nowadays, people are doing

39
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:03,694
integer multiplication on huge integers
because mathematical properties of

40
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:09,611
integers play an important role in
cartography and other applications. so,

41
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:16,712
people are interested in algorithms that
are faster than quadratic for something

42
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:26,177
like integer multiplication. now one, one
thing that you can do, first you can do

43
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:35,050
with reduction is people have figured out
that you can take integer division or

44
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:41,678
square or square root and all different
other integer operations and reduce them

45
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:47,201
to integer multiplication. So, you can
show that all of these and, and vice

46
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:52,902
versa. And so, you can show that all of
these things have the same complexity,

47
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:59,450
even though we all know what it is just by
simple reductions one to the other. so and

48
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,850
you can imagine how to do divide to
multiply and so forth. These have been

49
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,051
done in all different directions. so now,
the question is that so now, they're all

50
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:16,743
the same difficulty as the Brute force
algorithm and how hard is the Brute force

51
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:23,290
algorithm. well, people have studied that
for a long time and actually one of the,

52
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:30,477
the earliest divide and conquer algorithm
by Karatsuba and Ofman showed that the

53
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,527
integer multiplication could be done in
time into the 1.585. and it was divide and

54
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:44,104
conquer, we divide the integers in half
and then find a clever way to combine it

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,981
to reduce the exponents. And people have
been working on this. you can see through

56
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:56,747
the decades, actually, there's a big
breakthrough just in 2007 that is going to

57
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:03,524
get much closer to N log N. Although
there's no known lower bound for this

58
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:08,807
problem could be linear. And some people
are still going to work on it. so, and all

59
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:13,885
these different algorithms, they get more
complicated and may be, you know, useful

60
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:20,609
for very large N or for different ranges
of N. and actually in practice there's the

61
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:26,990
Multi Precision Library that's used in
many symbolic mathematics packages has one

62
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,754
of five different algorithms that it uses
for integer multiplication, depending on

63
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:39,583
the size of the operands. And, and again,
in applications such as cryptography the N

64
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:46,987
can be truly huge. And people want to do
this computation. so we don't know what

65
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:52,322
the difficulty of integer multiplication
is, we just know that all the integer

66
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:57,450
operations are described by this one
thing. And it's similar for a matrix

67
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,659
multiplication. one of the, another famous
problem that people are still trying to

68
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:07,744
understand. and again, the secondary
school algorithm to compute the entry in

69
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:12,768
row I and column J, you compute the dot
product of the Ith row of one argument,

70
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:17,667
and the Jth column of the other and the
dot product of that, that fills that

71
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:22,530
entry, and you do that for every entry, so
that's going to be time proportional to N

72
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,845
cube, because you have to do N
multiplications for each of the N^2

73
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:33,097
entries in the result matrix. and again
there's all different kinds of matrix

74
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:39,160
operations that can be proven to be
equivalent in difficulty to the matrix

75
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,449
multiplication through reduction. and so,
that's the you know, of called matrix

76
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:51,812
multiplication as all these other things
like solving systems of linear equations

77
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:57,876
and determine and, and other things. bu t
how difficult is it to multiply two

78
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:03,953
matrices. So again, reduction gives us a
big class of problems to make it even more

79
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:10,319
interesting to know the difficulty of this
one problem. and then, research on the

80
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,439
difficulty of this one problem has been
ongoing. in this case running time is N

81
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,239
cube for the brute force algorithm and who
knows when that was discovered I don't

82
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:30,652
know, eighteenth century or fifteenth or
something. and then but, when, once

83
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:37,375
computers got involved the Strassen's
famous divide and conquer algorithm like

84
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:43,093
you know, integer multiplication breaks it
down through divide and conquer and gets

85
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:49,567
the exponent down to 2.808. And people
have been working through the years to

86
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:57,531
find successive improvements to this. The
last one went from 2.3737 to 2.3727 which

87
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,098
doesn't seem like much, but maybe one of
these research results will be a

88
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:10,832
breakthrough that will give us an
efficient new algorithm for all of these

89
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:18,698
problems involving matrices. so again,
it's very useful to have classified all

90
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:26,560
these problems and make the even increase
the leverage of the research even more.

91
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,240
So, when we started this lecture we
started with the idea that it would be

92
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,546
good to classify problems. but it's, it's
tough to actually classify them because

93
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:43,880
there's new research involved, even for
things as simple as integer or matrix

94
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,213
multiplication but at least what we can do
is put the defined complexity classes.

95
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:55,546
even though we don't want to know what it
is, we know there's a lot of important

96
00:09:55,546 --> 00:10:01,480
problems that have that same complexity.
and there's a really important one that

97
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,680
we're going to talk about in the last
lecture, called the NP-complete problems,

98
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,231
and all kinds of important problems that
fall into that but as the time wears on,

99
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:20,149
researchers have found ways to put many,
many problems into, into, into equivalence

100
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:26,579
classes. so, at least we know that there's
those problems are have the same

101
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:33,091
difficulty even, even if we don't know
what it is. this is actually called the,

102
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:40,660
the complexity zoo there's really a large
number of complexity classes. now a lot of

103
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:49,625
these are de finitely theoretical devices
that are only important in filling in our

104
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:56,394
understanding of some, some important part
of the theory. but many of them like, like

105
00:10:56,394 --> 00:11:01,324
matrix multiplication, integer
multiplication, are very important to

106
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:08,020
practical algorithms. So there's certainly
a huge amount of research, I guess, still

107
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,760
going on into trying to understand
computational difficulty of the problems.

108
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,714
So, in summary, we use reductions to
design algorithms, to establish lower

109
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:25,028
bounds, and to help us classify problems.
but in practice, we've been using them

110
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:31,683
already. we, we designed algorithms that
made use of priority queues in effective

111
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:37,783
ways. That's a reduction and lots of
algorithms for sorting, and really that's

112
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:43,408
the idea of reusable software modules. We
find, you know, fundamental problems, and

113
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:49,508
we develop implementations that can be
used by clients. Every client using an

114
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:55,773
implementation is doing a reduction. and
the other thing is that reductions help us

115
00:11:55,966 --> 00:12:01,312
determine the difficulty of our problem
and guide our search towards finding

116
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:06,191
efficient solution for it. so in
particular, when we get to extremely

117
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:12,143
difficult problems, we'll know whether or
not we should look for an exact algorithm

118
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:18,023
or we should find something that doesn't
quite solve the problem. And we'll talk a

119
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:23,115
lot more about that in the last lecture.
And then all of these studies, in the

120
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:28,995
complexity zoo and in any algorithm that
we're going to develop for a complicated

121
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:34,230
problem, what we're going to want is
reduction to link the new problem to

122
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,740
problems that we know how to solve.
