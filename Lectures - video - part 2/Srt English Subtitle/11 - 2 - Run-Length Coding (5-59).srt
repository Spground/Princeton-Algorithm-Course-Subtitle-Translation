1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,017
As a warm up we're going to look at run
length encoding, which is actually an

2
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:14,024
effective method in many applications.
Simple method that's very effective. It's

3
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:19,285
based on the idea that it's very often the
case in a bit string that you have long

4
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:24,627
runs of repeated bits. So in this case,
there's a long run of zeros followed by a

5
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:30,073
medium length run of ones, another medium
length run of zeros, and then more ones.

6
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:35,654
So there's 40 bits but only switches from
zero to one in three places. And so what

7
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:41,598
you can do is rather than write out all
the bits. We can write counts to represent

8
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:47,367
alternating runs of zeroes and ones. A
very simple method. So in this case,

9
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:53,689
there's fifteen zeroes, seven ones, seven
zeroes and eleven ones. And, with four

10
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:59,671
bits to represent each one of these
counts, we can just write fifteen, seven,

11
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:05,639
seven, and eleven to get, instead of 40
bits, get down to sixteen bits. That's

12
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:12,467
effective, whether there's long runs of
zeroes and ones, in a bitstream. now, you

13
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:19,132
have to decide how many bits to use to
store the counts. it's not necessarily a

14
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:25,452
good idea to use, say, 32 bits. and maybe
four is too small. So, in our code, we use

15
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:30,696
eight bits. So that'll handle runs up to
256 bits. we used four in the example

16
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:36,202
above, but in a realistic thing, it's fine
to use eight. and then if we have longer

17
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:41,840
runs, then we have to figure out what to
do. if the run length is bigger than the

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,084
mass count, well, we can just intersperse
runs of length zero. And there's one way

19
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:52,460
to handle it, there's other ways to handle
it too. But this is a very simple scheme

20
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:58,904
that covers all the bases and can be a
very effective. and . For example,

21
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:06,091
consider a bit map representation of this
slide. There's huge long runs, saved with

22
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:14,129
black and white. There's huge long runs of
white that, depending on the resolution,

23
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:22,055
might be hundreds or 1000 bits, but could
be represented with just a few counts. and

24
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:27,259
so in many applications of bit maps of
texts and other things like that, this is

25
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:32,854
very effective and it's used in all kinds
of technologies like Jpeg and fax and

26
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:38,107
others. and it's very simple t o
implement. So this is our warmup data

27
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:44,478
compression algorithm that implements
run-length encoding. Actually we left the

28
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:50,700
compress for the book. this is just the
expand. so I'm given a bunch of counts.

29
00:02:51,050 --> 00:03:01,569
how do I reproduce the original
uncompressed text string into . It's as

30
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:10,455
simple as that. So log R is the number of
bits per count. and so basically what we

31
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:18,775
do is read log R bits at a time into an
end, whatever the value is, so we put that

32
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:24,406
into the end run. So, that's a number
between zero and 256, which is the maximum

33
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:30,326
you can get in eight bits. and then,
starting with zero the first count. That's

34
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:36,245
the number of zeroes we need to write, so
we just write them one, one bit at a time.

35
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:42,467
Zero at one bit at a time, and then we
flip the bit to make it one. and read the

36
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:48,947
next count, and now we, we write out that
many 1s and so forth. So this is a ten

37
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:55,912
line program that does, expansion for, run
length and coding. and you can, think

38
00:03:55,912 --> 00:04:03,218
about it or look at the book, for, how to
do, compression. it's just as simple. so

39
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:09,788
this is just the, an example of the
effectiveness of, learning some coding

40
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:16,690
for, one letter, the letter Q, in a, in a
typical black and white scheme doing. Even

41
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:24,660
for a single letter, there's, lots of,
redundancy, lots of runs of 0s. so with a

42
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,274
relatively small, number of counts. we
can, represent a, a bitmap. and this is

43
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:39,887
the hard case. actually, most of a printed
page is all this blank space, as I said.

44
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:48,466
so, Typically. If you just don't compress
at all and you have an eight and a half by

45
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:54,484
eleven piece of paper with three hundred
pixels per inch, that'd be eight million

46
00:04:54,484 --> 00:05:00,208
bits. But most of those are white, and
typically with run length and coding, you

47
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:05,785
can get substantial savings simply by
basically counting the white bits. And

48
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:11,362
even when there's letters involved, you
can get, say maybe there's only three

49
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:17,411
thousand characters. That's another
example. If it's all text then maybe the

50
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:25,325
text itself is a great way to compress it.
or the program or the document processor

51
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:31,405
that produced the text, but now we're
starting to get into undecidabi lity

52
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:38,210
issues. So lets think more in terms of a,
a page that has a, an image, a drawing,

53
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,247
and some text and so forth. so it makes
sense to start with a bitmap and then use

54
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:48,809
as few bits a possible. And then run
length encoding's going to be very

55
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:52,700
effective. that's our warm up case for
data compression.
