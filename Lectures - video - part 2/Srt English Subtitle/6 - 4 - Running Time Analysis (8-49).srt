1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,437
. So now we've got a general scheme for
computing Max Flow's Min cuts and the

2
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:13,549
proof that they are equivalent. Next what
we need to do is look at an analysis of

3
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,588
the, cost of computing things to try to
figure out, specific, efficient ways to

4
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:25,409
compute, augmenting paths. So we already
saw how to compute a Min cuts So we'll

5
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:31,445
just worry about doing the Max flow. To
find an augmenting path. Well there's lots

6
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:37,626
of ways to find an augmenting path. any
graph search is gonna work. so let's just

7
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:43,599
start with BFS for example. so if word
focusing terminates, that means there's no

8
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:49,086
augmenting path. Does it always compute
our Max slow? Yes, we showed that. and

9
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:54,851
well that's if it terminates. does it
always terminate? Does it oscillate back

10
00:00:54,851 --> 00:01:01,664
and forth? Well, it's a little more work.
to show that it does always terminate. if

11
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:07,072
you have to, a few other conditions. So
for simplicity, we assume that each

12
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,147
capacities are integers or there's other
things that can be done with a choice of

13
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:19,295
augmenting paths and maybe we'll come back
to that. But to figure out how many

14
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:25,545
augmenting paths there are, that's the key
that requires some clever analysis. and

15
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:31,860
there's been a lot of different schemes
studied to try to understand a way to

16
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:39,189
first find the paths cheaply and then
decide to try to see how, many, how we can

17
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:45,636
limit the number of augmentations. so,
let's look at a, at an important special

18
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:51,215
case. And it's true in lots of
applications. where the edge capacities

19
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:58,111
are integers, between one and some, big
maximum U. and, a lot of the things that

20
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:04,542
we talk about work when edge capacities
are, are, are real numbers. But let's just

21
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:10,580
talk about this case. so one thing to
notice in that case, is that our Ford

22
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,850
focus and method always keeps an integer
value of flow We never take half a flow

23
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,548
unit and put it through an edge. So it's
always integer valued, cause the flow on

24
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:31,246
each edge of the integer, capacities are
integers and so everything stays to be an

25
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:38,592
integer. every, every augmentation either
increases or decreases by the bottleneck

26
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:45,104
capacity, which is always an integer. s o,
one thing that's definitely true is you

27
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:51,595
only augment if you're gonna increase the
flow. you have to augment. You wouldn't

28
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:58,087
augment if you couldn't augment by at most
one. so it's definitely true that the

29
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:05,062
number of augmentations is less than or
equal to the value of the flow. . So

30
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:12,845
there's what's called the integrality.
Integrality theorem that is important for

31
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:18,130
some applications and we'll come back to
it, that says if there exists an integer

32
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,981
valued Max flow and Ford focus finds so
it's and waving a little bit to talk about

33
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:30,461
that but we'll work with intergers and
we'll be confident that we get to the

34
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:37,246
answer and so the proof of the Integraliy
theorem is that it terminates in the Max

35
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:43,770
flow that it finds is integer valued and
that's enough. So, but, just to get an

36
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,701
idea for what goes on, let's look at this
bad case. Even when the edge capacities

37
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:55,261
are integers, you could have a lot of
augmenting paths. And we want to avoid

38
00:03:55,261 --> 00:04:01,117
this case. So look at this network here,
where we have S and T. And we've got two

39
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:07,419
big capacity edges coming out of S and two
big capacity edges coming into T. And then

40
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,572
we have just a little edge of capacity one
going between those two intermediate

41
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:20,328
vertices. here's what could happen. so, in
the first generation we could decide that

42
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:26,345
we wanna push flow along the path that
goes across the middle. Now we're gonna

43
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:31,227
look in a lot of different schemes for,
finding augmenting paths, so, maybe, a

44
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:36,290
scheme says, if we have a choice, let's
take, as longer path as we can find. And

45
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,991
that, so, in this case, that's what it'd
do. There's another augmenting path that

46
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:46,536
just goes from S to the left vortex down
to P, but the algorithm, say, chooses this

47
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:51,914
one So we have an algorithm that chooses
this one So that increases the flow by one

48
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:59,648
but then the problem is, maybe the next
time, we make that middle edge a backwards

49
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:07,376
edge and so now we go through and increase
the flow by one along that edge and now we

50
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:14,001
have a total flow of two and then maybe we
alternate between these two schemes.

51
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:20,948
Increment by one in the left, increment by
one in the right. and it 's gonna take 200

52
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:27,939
iterations. to finally get to the Max
flow. whereas a different algorithm might

53
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:33,138
have gotten it done in two iterations and
a hundred's not so bad, but maybe these

54
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:38,275
weights are a billion or something. It
would take a billion iterations. So that's

55
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:42,670
bad news. Now that's too slow in
algorithm. We want to try to avoid that.

56
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,079
now there's an easy way to avoid that and
that's to use the shortest path or in

57
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,070
other ways to use the farthest path, the
one you can push the most flow through.

58
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,713
that's just an example of the kind of
pitfall that you wanna avoid and try to

59
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:06,133
come up with an algorithm for choosing
augmenting paths in Ford Fulkerson Now the

60
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:10,510
performance of the Ford Fulkerson in
algorithm is gonna depend on the method

61
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,127
used to choose the augmenting paths.
here's listed four easy ways to pick

62
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:22,272
augmenting paths and they're pretty easy
to implement. They're very similar to

63
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:28,174
Dijkstra's algorithm or Prim's algorithm
and others that we've looked at. But they

64
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:33,930
lead to a different number of augmenting
paths, depending on the network. So for

65
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,175
example, you could decide, let's use the
shortest path. So that's just the

66
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:45,050
augmenting path with the fewest number of
edges. and that's just, breath for a

67
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,156
search, essentially in the graph that
ignores the full forward and empty

68
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:56,282
backward edges. now it's been proven that,
there's no network for which the algorithm

69
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:01,850
uses more than one-half E times of E
paths. so at least that's an upper bound

70
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,924
that shows that it doesn't have this bad
performance involving the capacity. I want

71
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:12,876
to emphasize that this is a very
conservative upper bound on the number of

72
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:18,421
paths used. in an actual network it might
not use anywhere near that number of

73
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:23,852
augmentations. Another example is the
fattest path. so that's the augmenting

74
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:28,909
path, with maximum bottleneck capacity.
And again, that one is pretty easy to

75
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:33,966
implement. it's very similar to our
implementations of Dijkstra and Prim's

76
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:39,688
algorithm and we'll see in a minute. And
again, it can serve of upper bound on the

77
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:45,011
number of paths taken by that algorithm,
is the number of e dges times the log of

78
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:50,533
product of edges and capacity. but again,
that's a very conservative upper bound,

79
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:59,466
and in the real world it might only take a
few, augmentations to computing max flow,

80
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:05,530
using that method. Or you could use a
random path which again is easy to

81
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:12,263
implement, and randomized graph search. or
depth-first search. now these conservative

82
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:19,191
upper bounds are useful, but in real world
networks, these algorithms are going to

83
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:25,691
have running times that depend, really a
lot on properties of the network. So

84
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:32,533
people use diffent algorithms in different
situations and the fact is that, often, we

85
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:39,290
can get Max flow problems solved, even on
huge networks with a relatively small

86
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,600
number of augmenting paths.
