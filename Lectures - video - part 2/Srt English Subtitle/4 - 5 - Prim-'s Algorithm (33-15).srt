1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,067
Next we'll look at another classic
algorithm for computing the MST called

2
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:13,960
Prim's algorithm.
It's also an extremely simple algorithm to

3
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:20,294
state. What we're going to do now is start
with vertex zero and we're going to grow

4
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:24,238
the tree one edge at a time, always
keeping it connected.

5
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:30,296
The way we're going to do that is add to
the tree the minimum weight edge that has

6
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:36,001
exactly one endpoint in the tree computed
so far, and we'll keep doing that until

7
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,100
we've grown the whole v-minus one edge
tree.

8
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:42,340
Let's look at a demo to see how that
works.

9
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:47,376
So we start with vertex zero.
And we're supposed to add them in minimum

10
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:52,296
edge that's connected to zero.
So that's zero, seven Out of all the edges

11
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:55,980
connected to zero, that's the one of
minimum weight.

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,520
So now we have one edge, two vertices on
the tree.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,720
And so now we want to add the min weight
edge that connects to the tree.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,498
In this case, that's seven, one out of all
the edges that connect to the tree, one,

15
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:14,544
seven is the shortest one, so that's the
one that we add.

16
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:20,106
So now we have two edges on the tree.
Continuing now, the min weight edge that

17
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:24,040
connects to the tree is zero, two so, we
add that one.

18
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,987
So, now we have three edges, four vertices
on the tree.

19
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:33,837
The closest edge, the closest vertex to
the tree or the smallest edge coming out

20
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,150
of the tree is two, three so we add that
one.

21
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:43,752
So now we have three more vertices to go,
and you can see that the next one that's

22
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:48,517
going to come is five.
That's closer, to the three than four or

23
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:52,229
six.
So we do that, add five, now there's two

24
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,255
more and so, out of all those edges, the
closest one to the tree is 45.

25
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,580
It's a little shorter than four, seven and
zero, four.

26
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:08,408
So that's the one that gets added and then
finally six gets added to the tree by the

27
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,516
surest edge that connects it to the tree,
which is six, two.

28
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:19,182
So start with vertex zero, add an edge at
a time to the tree, it's the shortest edge

29
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:25,150
that goes from, a tree vertex to a
non-tree vertex, that's Prim's algorithm.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:32,545
Now let's look at Prim's algorithm running
on, on the same huge graph that we ran for

31
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:36,747
Kruskal's.
This is also a fascinating dynamic

32
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:42,153
process.
Usually, the new edge, is, close to, the

33
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:46,963
last edge added.
But every once in a while, it gets stuck.

34
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:51,945
And so, jumps to a new place, to add
edges, to the MST.

35
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:55,982
This algorithm's a little bit easier to
follow.

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,020
But it's a very interesting dynamic
process.

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,621
You can see that it, when it's easy, it
just sticks where it was.

38
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:13,343
And when it runs into some long edges, it
gets stuck and tries somewhere else.

39
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:19,362
Always adding to the tree, the shortest
edge that connects a non-tree vertex to a

40
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:23,374
tree vertex.
And you can see the last few things to be

41
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:27,090
added where the vertices in the upper left
corner.

42
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,730
So that's a visualization of Prinz
algorithm.

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,131
Completely different character, but comes
out to the same tree as Kruskal's

44
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,300
algorithm as long as the edge weights are
distinct.

45
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:45,541
So we need to prove Prim's algorithm
correct and this one has been rediscovered

46
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:52,477
a, a few times depending on how you cast
the data structure for implementing

47
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:57,536
finding the minimum.
But the basic algorithm has been known

48
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:04,961
since at least 1930 and it's proof that it
computes the MST again comes because it's

49
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,470
a special case of the greedy MST
algorithm.

50
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:16,007
So the, let's suppose that E is the
min-win weight edge connecting the vertex

51
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:22,331
on the tree to a vertex not on the tree.
Well, you just, you take, as your cut, the

52
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:26,679
tree vertices.
There's no black crossing edge from the

53
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:31,579
tree vertices to non tree vertex.
That's a definition that's not on the

54
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,237
tree.
And there's no crossing edge of low

55
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:39,309
weight, cuz that's the minimum one.
That we picked by design.

56
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:44,830
So it's a special case of the Greedy
algorithm where you take, as the cut, the

57
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:49,335
set of vertices currently on the tree.
That's Prim's algorithm.

58
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:53,105
Now how are we going to implement Prim's
algorithm?

59
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:58,550
How are we going to find the minimum
weight edge with exactly one point and T?

60
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,978
Well, one thing that we could do is just
try all the edges.

61
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:07,712
And, maybe some early implementations that
would do that.

62
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:13,210
But what we're going to do is use a modern
data structure of priority q.

63
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,776
So we're going to keep the, edges, on a
priority queue.

64
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:22,125
But, have exactly one end point in T.
And then we can just, pick out the minimum

65
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,883
weight one.
That's a so called, lazy implementation of

66
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:29,513
Prim's algorithm.
We'll look at another one, called the

67
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:34,225
eager implementation afterwards.
So, what we need to do is find the minimum

68
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,410
weight edge with exactly one endpoint in
the tree.

69
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,866
So, the solution is to make a priority cue
of the edges that have at least one end

70
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:48,747
point in the tree.
And then we, using as priority, the key is

71
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:52,841
the edge and the priority is the weight of
the edge.

72
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:59,962
And so, we're going to. Use delete min to
find the next edge to add to the tree.

73
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:04,390
And then we have to update the priority
queue.

74
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:10,877
When we consider that edge, now there's
going to be some edges on the priority

75
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:17,711
queue that are obsolete, and we've already
found better ways to connect them, so

76
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:25,063
we'll just disregard an edge that has both
endpoints in the tree, we've already found

77
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:32,070
a way to connect them and we don't need
that edge for the minimum spanning frame.

78
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,891
That's why it's called a lazy
implementation.

79
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:39,343
We allow stuff to be on the priority queue
that we know is obsolete.

80
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:44,799
And then when we pull it off the queue we
test whether it belongs in the tree or

81
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,683
not.
But then the key step in the algorithm is

82
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:53,326
to assume, is to, what do you do when you
get a new vertex for the minimum pan in

83
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:57,590
tree and a new edge.
So that means that one of the vertices is

84
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,854
on the tree, let's say that's v and the
other one is not on the tree.

85
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,740
That means W.
And so what we want to do is add W to the

86
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,734
tree but then we also want to add to the
priority Q, any edge that's incident to W.

87
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:17,655
So that's got the possibility, as long as
this other end point is not in the tree.

88
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:23,503
So those edges have the possibility of
being minimum spanning tree edges in the

89
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:29,643
future unless some better way to connect
their incident vertex to the tree is found

90
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:33,565
before they come off the queue.
And that's the algorithm.

91
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:37,869
A lazy solution of Primm's algorithm.
So lets take a demo of that.

92
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:42,770
So what we're going to do is start with a
vertex and really grow the tree.

93
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,670
Add to T the mid-weight edge with exactly
one end-point entry in the tree.

94
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,775
That's Primm's algorithm.
But now we're going to show the data

95
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:55,153
structure, the priority Q, that allows us
to do this.

96
00:07:55,153 --> 00:08:00,450
By keeping all the edges that we know
about that connect, that possibly could be

97
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,977
that edge on priority Q.
So let's look at what happens, for our

98
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:07,647
sample graph.
So we start at vertex zero,

99
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:11,519
That's fine.
Now, we're going to add that, to the tree,

100
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,460
vertex zero to the tree, and we're going
to put in the priority queue, all the

101
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,734
edges that are, incident to zero.
And just for, the demo, we'll just show

102
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:27,074
the, edges sorted by weight, with the
understanding that we have a heaped data

103
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:31,480
structure or something under there, to
give us the smallest one.

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,620
But, for the demo, it's easiest to see,
them sorted by weight.

105
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:42,340
Okay so then to greenly grow the tree we
have to pick 0,7 off the priority queue.

106
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:54,337
But and so we'll show that one on the MST.
And then the vertex that's not, on the

107
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:59,837
tree at that point is seven, so we're
going to add seven to the tree.

108
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:06,605
So first we add zero, seven to be an MST
edge, and then we add to the priority

109
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:13,851
queue all the edges that are incident to
seven, that. All the edges into, incident

110
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:18,598
to seven that point to places, the
vertices that are not on the tree that are

111
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:21,386
connected to vertices that are not on the
tree.

112
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:25,658
So we don't put zero, seven back on'cause
zero is already on the tree.

113
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:31,770
So we put all those on a priority queue.
And, again, keep them sorted by weight.

114
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:37,981
So, now let's continue.
So smallest thing is one, seven.

115
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:46,404
That's the smallest edge, to a from a tree
edge to a non-tree edge.

116
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,338
And so that's, delete 1,7 from the
priority queue and add it to the MSTs, so

117
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:56,444
we do that.
And now that takes us to one and so now we

118
00:09:56,444 --> 00:10:02,639
have to add to the priority queue, all the
edges that, connect, one to non-tree

119
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,241
edges.
So that's what the asterisks are, are the

120
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:11,860
new, new edges on the priority queue.
And again, we keep ''em sorted by weight.

121
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,772
So now what we want on the priority queue
is a subset of the, you wanna be sure that

122
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:23,473
every edge that connects a tree edge to a
non-tree edge is on the priority queue.

123
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:28,330
We might have a few others as well, and
we'll see that in, in a second.

124
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,064
So now 0,2's the smallest so we take 0,2
and add it to the MST.

125
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:39,377
So notice now that once we add two to the
MST, this edge between one and two becomes

126
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:43,059
obsolete.
It's never going to be added to the MST.

127
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:49,222
At the time that we put one on, we thought
maybe that was a good way to get to two.

128
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:53,055
But now we know there's a better way to
get to two.

129
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,315
So that edge becomes obsolete.
And the lazy implementation just leaves

130
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:07,467
that edge on the priority Q.
So let's now continue, so, we added, two

131
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:13,432
to the, 0-2 to the MST.
And we have to add, everybody infinite the

132
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:18,459
two, that, is not on the tree, to the
priority queue.

133
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:24,595
So, in this case, it's 2-3 and 6-2.
We don't have to add 1-2 and 2-7, 'cause

134
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:28,600
they go to three edges.
We don't add'em back on.

135
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,815
Okay, so now the smallest is two, three.
So take that, add it to the MST.

136
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:42,383
And add all the edges incident to three to
non-tree vertices, in this case it's just

137
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,265
three, six.
And that's a long one.

138
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:49,500
So now the next edge for the MST is five,
seven.

139
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:53,606
Take that off the priority queue, put it
on the MST.

140
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:59,918
And so and now all peak, all edges
incident to five that go to non tree

141
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:03,340
vertices.
It says just five, four and that one.

142
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,917
So now the next edge that would come off
the priority que is one, three but, that's

143
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:15,093
an obsolete edge.
We already have one, three connected in

144
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:20,014
the MST because we were lazy and left that
in the priority que.

145
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:25,755
So now we just pull it off and, and
discard it, because it connects through

146
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,141
three vertices.
Same with 1,5.

147
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:31,496
We already have a better way to connect
them.

148
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:36,566
2,7 connects through three vertices.
And finally we get to four, five.

149
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,521
4,5 now gets deleted.
And from the priority queue, and add it to

150
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:45,092
the MST.
Everybody connected to four, that's just

151
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:50,835
six, and that's a long one, goes on.
Now we have some obsolete edges we'll get

152
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:54,687
to that one too.
And then four, seven is obsolete, and

153
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:59,379
zero, four is obsolete.
And finally, the last edge to get added to

154
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,459
the MST is six, two.
And after deleting 6-2 from the priority

155
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,688
queue and adding the MST we have, computed
the MST.

156
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:15,630
We have V minus one edges on V vertices,
and that's, implementation of the lazy

157
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,816
version of Prim's algorithm.
And it's just a version of Prim's

158
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:27,039
algorithm we showed was the underlying
data structure, the priority queue, that

159
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:33,023
ensures that we always get the shortest
edge connecting a tree vertex to a

160
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:37,551
non-tree vertex.
So let's look at the code for Prim's

161
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:42,472
algorithm.
Again, the data structures that we build

162
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:50,293
up in part one of this course, give us a
very compact implementation of this MST

163
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:55,302
algorithm.
So we're going to need three instance

164
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,905
variables.
One is a existence array.

165
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:04,090
A vertex indexed array of bullions, that
for each vertex.

166
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,191
Will tell us whether or not it's on the
MST.

167
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:13,536
Then we have the, list of edges on the
MST, that, is going to be, returned to the

168
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:17,202
client after the MST is computed, to, for
iterable.

169
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:23,688
And then we we'll have the priority queue
of edges that, connect, tree vertices with

170
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:27,989
non-tree vertices.
The super-set of the edges that connect

171
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,950
tree vertices and non-tree vertices.
So.

172
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:35,546
Given a graph we'll build a priority
queue.

173
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:46,346
We'll initialize all the data structures.
And then we'll visit, and we'll show what

174
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:50,598
the routine does.
That's the one that processes each vertex

175
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:55,440
when it gets added to, to the tree.
We'll look at that in the next slide.

176
00:14:55,705 --> 00:15:03,585
So the main loop is, while the priority q
is not empty, we pull off the minimum edge

177
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:09,341
from the priority q.
We get it's constituent vertices, if their

178
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:14,943
both marked then we just ignore it.
They're already on the MST.

179
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:22,267
Otherwise, we put the edge on the MST.
And which ever vertex was not on the tree,

180
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:28,943
we visit and put on the tree.
And the visit routine is the one that puts

181
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:35,990
the vertex on the tree and puts all of its
indecent edges on the priority Q.

182
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:44,930
So to visit a vertex we set its entry,
corresponding entry in the marked array to

183
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:51,523
be true, so it's, added to the tree.
And then for, every edge, that's adjacent

184
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:57,733
to that, we're going to, if it's, other
edge is not marked, we're going to put it

185
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:02,256
on the priority Q.
So if it's an edge that goes from a tree

186
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:06,550
vertex to a non-tree vertex, we put it on
the priority Q.

187
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:14,140
And then, we have the, client query method
to, get the MST, once the, MST is built.

188
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,112
Again, the data structures that we've used
give a very compact and complete

189
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,430
implementation of Prim's, Prim's
algorithm.

190
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:30,662
What's the running time of the algorithm?
Well, it's correct cuz it implements

191
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:37,619
Prim's algorithm as we've showed us in the
sense of a greedy algorithm.

192
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:45,217
And it's easy to see that the running time
is always going to be proportional to E

193
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:51,168
log E in the worst case.
And that's because you could put all the

194
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:58,209
edges on priority Q and. So, every edge
would, might, would have to come off the

195
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:04,350
priority cue, so that's e times, and then
the cost would be proportional to e for,

196
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:08,705
inserting and deleting, every edge off the
priority cue.

197
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,250
So, E log e is sorry, is a fine running
time.

198
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,743
The space, extra space proportional to e
is you know, might be considered annoying,

199
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:27,654
or inelegant, or inefficient so there's a
more efficient version of Prim's algorithm

200
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:31,913
where we clear off that dead weight on the
priority queue.

201
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:37,917
And that's the eager implementation of
Prim's algorithm that we'll look at next.

202
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:44,131
In practice, the lazy implementation works
pretty well, but the eager implementation

203
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,329
is all.
So a very elegant and efficient algorithm,

204
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:52,179
and it's worth learning both.
So for the eager solution, what we're

205
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:56,689
going to do is.
The priority Q is going to have vertices.

206
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:00,876
And it's going to have, at most, one entry
per vertex.

207
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:07,641
And so those are the vertices that are not
on the tree but are connected by an edge

208
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,668
to the tree.
And the priority of a given vertex is

209
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:18,030
going to be the weight of the shortest
edge connecting that vertex to the tree.

210
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:29,311
So if we look at this little example here
Where we've build the tree for zero, seven

211
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:37,855
and one then the Black.
Entries in this are the ones, the edges

212
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:42,278
that are on the MST.
So that's zero, seven and one, seven and

213
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:49,966
the red ones are the ones that are on the
priority Q because they're connected by an

214
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:56,654
edge to some vertex that's on the tree.
And for each one of them, there's a

215
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:03,794
particular edge that connects, that's
shortest, that connects that vertex to the

216
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:07,590
tree.
So that's the key for the priority Q.

217
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:13,117
So that's what we're, that's what we're
going to want for at any time during the

218
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:17,552
execution of the algorithm.
We're going to want the vertices that are

219
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:22,308
connected to the tree by one vertex.
And, and we're going to know the shortest

220
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:27,321
edge connecting that vertex to the tree.
So then, the algorithm is again, delete

221
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:30,920
the minimum vertex.
And it's got an associated edge that

222
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,520
connects it to the tree, and we put that
one on the tree.

223
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,669
And then we have to update the priority
queue.

224
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,883
So why do we have to update the priority
queue.

225
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:44,445
So we have.
This vertex that's not on the tree, we

226
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:48,878
consider all of the edges that are
incident to that vertex.

227
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:53,461
If they point to a tree vertex then we're
going to ignore it.

228
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:57,894
That's no problem.
If it's not already on the priority Q,

229
00:19:57,894 --> 00:20:01,876
we're going to put that new vertex on the
priority Q.

230
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:08,037
And then other thing is, if the vertex is
on the priority Q and we just found a

231
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:14,274
shorter way to get to it, then we're going
to have to decrease the priority of that

232
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:18,723
vertex.
So, let's look at how that works in a

233
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:22,053
demo.
So, again, it's just an implementation of

234
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,997
Prim's algorithm.
It's just how to we get the min weight

235
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:31,009
edge that connects to the tree?
And this is a, a more efficient way to do

236
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:34,377
it.
So, again, we start out with our graph,

237
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:42,081
started zero, and, let's get going.
So, now, the priority QS vertices, and so

238
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:49,101
there's four vertices that are just one
edge away from the tree, and, we keep'em

239
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:54,580
on the priority queue, in order of their
distance to the tree.

240
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:59,569
So, and we also keep the edge.
Two vertice, vertex index arrays.

241
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:05,750
One is the edge that takes us to the tree,
and the other is the length of that edge.

242
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:11,381
And again we'll keep sorted on the
priority queue just to make the demo

243
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:15,552
easier to follow.
So the next vertex to go on the tree is

244
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:20,162
seven.
The next edge to get added to the tree is

245
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:25,380
edge two of seven.
And then we go from there.

246
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,044
So that's the smallest one, we take that
for the tree and now we have to update the

247
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:35,738
priority q.
So, how do we update the priority q?

248
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:42,734
Well we have to look at, everybody
incident the seventh, and so, let's look

249
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,389
at, so, for example, 7-2.
We don't need to put 7-2 in the priority

250
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:53,153
queue, since we already have a better way
to connect two to the tree, thats 2-0.

251
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:57,070
So we don't have to change anything.
Same with 7-4.

252
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:01,657
And about 7-5, and 7-1.
One and five are not on the priority

253
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:05,045
queue.
So, we have to put them on the priority

254
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:08,432
queue.
And, then save the edges in length that,

255
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:12,455
get them, to seven which would get them to
the tree.

256
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:16,266
So now, on our priority queue, we have our
current tree.

257
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:20,924
And we have all vertices that were within
one edge of the tree.

258
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:25,230
And the edge that gets'em to the tree, and
their length.

259
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,900
So, we're ready for another step of the
algorithm.

260
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:37,006
So now seventeen is the smallest thing in
the priority queue.

261
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:45,847
And so we put that on the MST.
And now we look at everybody connected to

262
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,796
one.
And again, one seven we [inaudible],

263
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:53,169
because it's on the tree.
One five we don't need cuz we have a

264
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:57,878
shorter way to get to the tree.
One two we don't need cuz we have a

265
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:04,001
shorter way, to get, two to the tree, but
we haven't seen three yet so we add vertex

266
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:09,517
three to the priority cue and say we get
to the tree by one, one three, distance

267
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:13,352
point two nine.
Every, all the vertices within one edge of

268
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:17,860
the tree and the edge and length of the
shortest edge that gets.

269
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,860
To the tree from that vertex, that's what
we're maintaining at every step.

270
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,860
Okay so next vertex to come to the tree is
two and so we put that on the tree and now

271
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,252
we look at everybody that connected to
two, so now we have our first example of

272
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:41,340
decrease key but let's, let's check them
all.

273
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,150
So two, zero.
Two, seven, and two, one, take us to

274
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,907
vertices that are already on the tree.
So it's two, three and two, six.

275
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:57,765
So what we need to do for three, we had
thought that the best way to get to three

276
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:04,877
from the tree from three was to go to one.
And adding this new edge two means we now

277
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,941
know a better way to get from three to the
tree.

278
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:14,384
So we have to update the priority.
Update the edge two, in the priority we

279
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:19,908
have to decrease the key of the priority.
So that's an operation that we're going to

280
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:24,380
need from our priority Q.
And it's something that has to be factored

281
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,458
into our priority Q implementation.
And the same thing for six.

282
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:33,982
We thought we had a good way to get to the
tree from zero but two brings six closer

283
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:37,270
to the tree so we have to update that
information.

284
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:42,663
And say now the best way to get from six
to the three is 6,2 and that it's length.

285
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:45,820
We have to decrease the key.
And this definitely.

286
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,711
Involves summary shuffling in the priority
queue and our implementation is going to

287
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:55,021
take that into account.
So, with those changes now, we have the

288
00:24:55,021 --> 00:25:00,294
following situation.
And, we've got, four edges on the tree.

289
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:04,854
Three edges on the tree.
Now we're going to add the fourth, which

290
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:08,560
is 2-3.
That's the smallest thing on the priority

291
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,982
queue.
So we add, two, three to the MST.

292
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:16,754
And now we have to go to the, things
connected to three, And, well, there's

293
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:20,816
nothing to add, since we already have a
better way to six.

294
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:30,429
So next one that gets added is 5-7.
And check, so, edges from five, seven.

295
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:39,262
So.
We from five, We're going to decrease the

296
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:46,045
key of four from.38 to.5.'Cause the best
way to get from four to the tree is no

297
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:51,556
longer 4,0, it's 4,5.
So again, decrease the key and discard the

298
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:57,067
longer edge to the tree.
And in fact, that's the next edge that we

299
00:25:57,067 --> 00:26:01,222
pick.
And we don't bother putting forth six on,

300
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:06,564
'cause we already have a better way to get
from six to the tree.

301
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,210
And then the last edge that we had was
6,2.

302
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:17,061
Again, it's the easy version of Prim's
algorithm is an implementation that always

303
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:22,051
connects to the tree, the vertex that's
closest to the tree.

304
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:26,450
But we use a more efficient data structure
to do it.

305
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:33,217
That can only have one, at most one entry
per vertex, as opposed to one entry per

306
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,297
edge.
So that's the eager version of the Prim's

307
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:40,234
algorithm.
Okay rather than focus on the code for the

308
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:44,759
eager version.
Which is quite similar to the code for the

309
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,422
lazy version.
We're going to talk briefly about the Key

310
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:53,481
data structure that we need to implement
this.

311
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:59,921
And it's the implementation of the
priority Q that allows us to decrease

312
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:04,244
keys.
And so, this is a advanced version of the

313
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:09,361
priority Q that we talked about in part
one of the course.

314
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:13,242
But it's necessary for algorithms like
this.

315
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:21,048
So what we're going to do, The problem is.
We have keys that the priority queue

316
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:28,174
algorithm doesn't really, Needs to know
when we change values of keys, and so we

317
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:33,896
have to do that through the API.
And so what we're going to do is allow the

318
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:39,264
client to change the key by specifying the
index and the, and the new key.

319
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:45,268
And then the implementation will take care
of changing the value and updating its

320
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:48,518
data structures to reflect the changed
values.

321
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,413
You can't have the client changing values
without informing the implementation.

322
00:27:55,638 --> 00:28:01,928
The priority queue implementation.
That's the basic challenge for this data

323
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:07,096
structure.
So since we are working with vertex

324
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:12,113
indexed arrays and graphs.
And, the priority queue implementation

325
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:16,157
might do the same.
We'll just associate an index.

326
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:19,902
Kind of pass that idea onto the priority,
queue.

327
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:24,920
To make it allow it to implement these
operations officially.

328
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:32,263
So the constructor gets to know how many
indices or how many keys there are going

329
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:38,396
to be at most ever in the priority Q.
And so it can make use of that to

330
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:43,148
implement efficient data structures for
the operations.

331
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:47,900
And so insert just associates a key with a
given index.

332
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:55,497
Decrease key allows to decrease the keys
associated with a given index we can

333
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:59,434
check.
Whether that's a bug should be Mth K.

334
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:05,509
Is an index on the priority Q.
We can remove a minimal key and give it's

335
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:10,149
associated index.
Check whether it's empty and give its

336
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:14,114
size.
Now it's pretty much a topic for part one

337
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:20,863
of the course, but we'll give just one
slide here to show how these indeces kind

338
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:26,179
of help things go around.
We're basically going to use the same

339
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:33,074
code, the heap based implementation of min
PQ. But we'll keep parallel arrays that

340
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:38,183
allows us to access quickly all the
information that we need.

341
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:44,631
So things on the queue are accessed by
index, and so we'll keep the values in

342
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:50,995
keys, so that's where the keys are.
So PQ of I will give the index of the key

343
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:57,611
that's in heap position I and QPI is the
heap position of the key with index I.

344
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:04,060
So that is the information that you need
when the client changes a value, you.

345
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:12,345
Need to get to the, you have to actually
first of all change the value but then you

346
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:18,798
may need to adjust the heap to, To reflect
the changed value.

347
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,340
So instead of a swim with an index, we use
the, we get the heat position of the given

348
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,091
index, and so forth.
So if you look in the book, you'll see the

349
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:35,542
code for index priority Q, and it's
definitely a confusing topic for a

350
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:41,383
lecture, but it's important to realize
that it's possible to implement this

351
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:47,146
decreased key operation in logarithmic
time without ever having to search

352
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:51,064
through.
Everything for anything, using the idea of

353
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:55,287
indexing.
So with that change, We get, for all the

354
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,038
operations, we get time proportional to,
log v.

355
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,822
And, what do we have to do for, the eager
version of Prim's Algorithm?

356
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:11,857
We, we have to, might have to insert every
vertex once, and delete min, every vertex

357
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:15,452
one.
And we might do as many as E decrease key

358
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:19,673
operations.
So that gives us a total running time of E

359
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:23,347
log V.
But the main thing is that the amount of

360
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:27,038
space for the priority q, is.
Only V not E.

361
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,842
And that can make a difference for a huge
graph.

362
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:35,756
So there are modifications that you can
make to this.

363
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:42,254
That give a more efficient running time.
For example, one easy thing to do is to

364
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:48,515
use since the operation we're performing
most often is the decreased key.

365
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:55,014
If we use a multi-way heap, like say a
four way heap, or in general a D way heap.

366
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:58,818
Then that reduces the cost of that
operation.

367
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:03,239
And it's.
Slightly increases the cost for insert and

368
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:09,935
delete min but there's not many of those,
so we can get the running time to log base

369
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:14,291
e over v of v.
And that, if you do the math for various

370
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:18,002
types of graphs, that's, that's going to
be faster.

371
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:24,376
And in fact a data structure called the
Fibonacci heap was invented in the'80s

372
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:30,669
that actually gets the running time down
to e plus v log b, although that data

373
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,336
structure's too.
Complimented to actually, too complicated

374
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:38,470
to actually use in practice.
If you have a, a dense graph.

375
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,865
Then you wouldn't even use a heap.
You'd just use an array and find the

376
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:48,188
minimum by going through, everything.
Since every vertex has, lots of connected

377
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:50,665
vertices.
So we didn't consider that one.

378
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:54,626
Because the huge graphs that we find in
practice are, are sparse.

379
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:57,226
And a binary heap is going to be much
faster.

380
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:01,374
And if you really have a
performance-critical situation, it's

381
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:06,017
worthwhile to do a four way heap.
That's the, basic bottom line in the

382
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,060
running time of Prim's algorithm.
