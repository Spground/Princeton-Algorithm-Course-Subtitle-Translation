1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,618
Now, first we're going to look at the
process of simulating the operation of an

2
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:16,411
NFA. And in order to do that, we have to
look at the representation. so for state

3
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:23,436
names we're just going to use the integers
from zero to N and those are just indexes

4
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:30,152
into the regular expression strain with
one extra one for the except state. So, if

5
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:36,288
RE has M characters, we've got M plus one
states. and then, we forget the

6
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:45,003
match-transitions. so for with this, we'll
just keep the regular expression in an

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:52,701
array. and then for characters that are
not metacharacters that are just

8
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:59,030
characters from the alphabet there's
match-transition just to the next element

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,831
just to add one, so that's an implicit
representation of the match-transitions.

10
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:10,934
and then the next thing is the epsilon
transitions. So, since there might be

11
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:17,188
multiple edges leaving from any given
state and it is directed, it always says,

12
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:23,406
go from this state to another one we'll
use directed graph. So we just have a

13
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:29,325
bunch of edges with given vertex names.
And that's convenient. That's what we use

14
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:34,778
for our graph processing algorithms, was
indexes for vertex names. so, this is

15
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:41,561
totally well-suited to building a digraph
using the basic digraph processing methods

16
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:47,551
that we talked about when doing graph
processing. so, that's our representation

17
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:54,098
and then given that representation it's
very, you know, straightforward to find

18
00:01:54,098 --> 00:02:01,692
out for any state what are the possible
next states and if it's got a character in

19
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:07,803
a possible next state is to match a
character in angle up one otherwise it's

20
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:14,455
the vertices that they are pointed to by
the edges and its adjacency list does have

21
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:21,187
epsilon transitions. So, let's take a look
at just given that basic idea, that we can

22
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:26,681
always get to the transition from any
given state how we're going to do a

23
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:35,274
simulation? and so, the idea is summarized
by this diagram here. what, what we're

24
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:42,172
going to do is at every step each text
character that the machine does read,

25
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:48,815
we're going to keep track of the, the set
of all possible states where the NFA could

26
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,214
be after reading in the i, I text ch
aracter.

27
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,455
So, say, we've done that and, you know,
there's this is just a schematic. So,

28
00:02:56,455 --> 00:03:03,533
there's a bunch of states that we could
get to after reading i characters. Now in

29
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:10,836
some of those states they, they are
labeled with characters. and if that

30
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:16,399
character matches our text character, they
can take us to another state. So, say, in

31
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:22,444
this case, there is three of them that
matches and the other one has some other

32
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:27,733
character or different character and it
couldn't take us to another state. So,

33
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:33,434
that gives us a all the possible states
that you could be in just after reading

34
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:38,585
the i plus first symbol. And now, what we
do is take a look at the possible null

35
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:44,432
transitions that we could go to from those
states. And that might take us to lots of

36
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:49,732
other states. but that's all the machine
could do. It could read a character. And

37
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:54,842
then it can take a bunch of null
transitions. and but that's all it knows

38
00:03:54,842 --> 00:04:00,016
how to do. And that will give us all the
possible states that it could be in after

39
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:04,643
reading i1 plus one symbols. And then, we
just continue in that from every one of

40
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:09,517
those states. some of them match the
character match the character, and then,

41
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:14,331
look at all the epsilon transitions. So,
that's the basic idea is to simply keep

42
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:20,228
track of all possible states the NFA could
be in after reading the first i text

43
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,332
characters. so the only thing that's
complicated is how do we get all the

44
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:30,950
states that we could reach by epsilon
transition. and we'll look at that in just

45
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,458
a second. It's actually very
straightforward. But let's look at a demo

46
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:43,071
first. so this is our machine for A<i>B or
A, or AC followed by D. and let's suppose</i>

47
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:50,797
it has this input. So, let's do this demo.
Okay. So, we're going to, to check if the

48
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:56,738
input is matching the pattern. we're going
to start the machine in state zero and so

49
00:04:56,953 --> 00:05:03,151
the zero is one of the states, you could
reach from the start. and then now we want

50
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:08,103
to get to all the states that you could
reach by epsilon transitions from the

51
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:14,289
start. and so there's a bunch of them so
we could go to one and from one, we could

52
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:19,927
go to either two or six. from two, we
could go to three. From three, we could go

53
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:25,355
to two or four. so we could get to all
those places from the start without

54
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:29,865
scanning a single character. So, zero,
one, two, three, four, and six the machine

55
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:35,700
could be in any one of those states before
it scans a single character. so, that's

56
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,932
where it could be after zero characters.
But what about now after the first

57
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:47,665
character? Well, out of those states only
two and six involve matching an A. So the

58
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:54,894
only thing that could happen next to read,
the machine could do next, is to read the

59
00:05:54,894 --> 00:06:01,790
A in either state two or state six. I know
there's going to be match-transitions. So

60
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,975
in the first case, it goes to three and,
and the second case, it goes to seven. So,

61
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:12,378
the stead of states, it can be reachable
just after matching the A, is just three

62
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:17,552
and seven. But now from those states it
might get somewhere with epsilon

63
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:22,909
transitions. We have to look at the
epsilon transition graphs and what states

64
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:28,475
could it go to from epsilon transitions
from these two. well, from three, seven

65
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:34,458
has nowhere to go, and from three it could
go either to two or four. from two, it

66
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:40,511
could go back to three so the total number
states that it could be after matching A

67
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:46,393
is two, three, four, and seven. and so
that's one step. We've matched one

68
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:51,818
character, and we have kept track of all
possible states the machine could be in

69
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:56,972
after matching that character. Now, what
about the next character? You can see,

70
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:02,126
these four states take us all different
ways. You could have an A, a B, or a C

71
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:07,551
next, and it could get somewhere. But it
happens, we have an A, and the only one of

72
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:13,654
these states that matches an A is two. So,
after matching the second A the only place

73
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:19,575
it could get to is three. and so that now,
we have only one state to work with. But

74
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:24,892
where could we get with via epsilon
transitions, from three? and so, well, you

75
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:30,345
can go from three to four or two. Well, we
did this before. And then, from two back

76
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:35,925
to three. So, we could be in two, three,
or four after matching two As. so that's

77
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:41,526
all the possible states we could be in
after mat ch, after matching the two As.

78
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:47,781
now, what's next is B, only state four
matches to B, so the only place we could

79
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:54,601
be right after matching the B is in state
five. And that's after matching the B, now

80
00:07:54,601 --> 00:08:01,491
what about epsilon transitions? Well,
state five has an epsilon transition to

81
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:08,156
state eight. so we could take that one and
eight has got one to nine. So it could be

82
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:14,075
an either five, eight, or nine after
matching AAB and then following all of the

83
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:19,149
epsilon transitions. but its really
important to keep in mind, there's no

84
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:24,928
other state the machine could be and it
doesn't have any other way to get to after

85
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:30,989
matching AAB it couldn't get state seven
or six or two. those are the only possible

86
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:37,299
states it could be in. since we're, each
time, progressing through the input we're

87
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:44,438
making progress to the end for sure. So
now to finish up this example the only

88
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:50,387
state out of those three that matches D is
state nine. and so, that's a

89
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:57,100
match-transition that reads the D. and the
only place you could be after matching

90
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,446
AABD is state ten. and then now, we follow
epsilon transitions. and that Epsilon

91
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:09,177
transition could take us to eleven. so,
the only place that machine could be after

92
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:14,980
matching ABD is ten or eleven. Now, our
condition on whether we accept the string

93
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,428
or not is whether we could get to the
accept state, and in this case, we could.

94
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:26,443
it is possible for the machine to get from
zero to the accept state and read all the

95
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:32,065
input characters so that simulation is
approved, that the machine accepts the

96
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:38,281
input AABD when simulated its operation,
all possible ways and we managed to find

97
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:44,114
the accept state. Of course, if we had
tried some input that the machine doesn't

98
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:50,254
recognize, we'd get stuck somewhere and
either not get through the input or have

99
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:56,163
no possible states it could be in. and
that would be a proof that it does not

100
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:02,529
accept since we try all possibilities. So,
the only thing that's complicated in this

101
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:08,584
computation is reachability. but actually
from our study of digraphs this is the,

102
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:14,146
one of the simplest problems that we
discussed. what we really discussed was

103
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:20,201
single source reachability. That is given
the source, can you find all vertices that

104
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:26,797
are reachable from that source? And that
was Depth Firts Search. so we have very

105
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:36,127
simple depth first search but also in that
API we put vertices reachable from a set

106
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:43,591
of sources, so an iterable of sources and
so can we get the, the, what we really

107
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:50,700
need is all vertices reachable from a
given source from its source set of

108
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,736
vertices. and it's easy using DFS. You
just run it from each of the sources and

109
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:02,845
you don't unmark the ones that you get to
and that stops DFS from revisiting any

110
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:08,736
vertices and it marks all the vertices
that you could get to from that set. So,

111
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:14,772
its just a simple extension of our DFS
implementation. it's going to run in time

112
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:20,881
proportional to the number of edges plus
number of vertices in the digraph and it's

113
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:26,988
a very simple computation digraph
reachability. so given that capability

114
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:34,358
which we discussed in graph processing the
implementation of in a, in the NFA

115
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:43,306
stimulation is very straightforward. so
this is a, a data type that implements the

116
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:52,146
NFA. so, we have a constructor that takes
a regular expression as its argument. and

117
00:11:52,146 --> 00:12:02,776
it's going to build the NFA and its got a,
a method to build the digraph that we'll

118
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:10,964
talk about later but, but its also got a,
a client method recognizes where the

119
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:19,852
client can after the NFA is constructed,
it can that they could text string and

120
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,300
return true or false by simulating the
operation. so we'll take a look at the

121
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:34,292
building the digraph in a second but the
one that we're talking about now is

122
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:41,569
simulating the operation of the NFA once
it's built for a given text string. and

123
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:49,575
this is the complete code and it's
expresses in code what we talked about in

124
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:56,485
English during the demo. it's amazingly
compact implementation of this idea of

125
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:03,480
simulating the operation of an NFA. So we
keep a, a bag of integers or set of

126
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,222
integers called PC, that's kind of like
program counter. So, that's the set of all

127
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:18,820
possible states that the NFA could be in.
so and we build a DFS from our epsilon

128
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:35,039
transition graph. so the first thing that
we do is do a, a, a for we put on to the,

129
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:42,570
the PC all the states that you could get
to from state zero. so that's build a DFS

130
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:49,317
that marks all the states you could get to
from state zero and then go through and

131
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:55,436
put all of the states on, on to the PC.
So, that's our starting point, is all the

132
00:13:55,436 --> 00:14:02,418
places that you could get to via epsilon
transitions from state zero. So now during

133
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:10,407
the execution of this for loop PC is the
thing that we have all the states that you

134
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:17,192
could reach after scanning past the ith
character, so we initialize for the 0th

135
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:23,815
character. And then all we do is for
everyone one of those states well, first

136
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:30,842
thing we do is test if we reach the accept
state. If we reach the accept state we're

137
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:37,546
going to have nothing, we're, we have
nothing left to do. if we have a match,

138
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:44,275
that is, if the a character in the RE if
that state position matches our ith text

139
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:49,856
character, then we're going to keep
another set of possible states called

140
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:55,360
match. So, those are the ones you could
get to just after matching a text

141
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,411
character. And so, we'll just add V. plus
one. So, if we find a matching character

142
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:05,735
at V, we just go to V plus one, that's the
implicit match-transition. and here, we'll

143
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:11,479
throw in, don't care, cuz it's so easy to
do if the regular, regular expressions

144
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:17,854
says, I don't care what character matches
then throw that one to. so this just adds

145
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:24,298
don't care to the implementation. and so
we do that for all states in our PC in the

146
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:32,602
states we can, can be in just before, just
while looking at the ith character. If we

147
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:39,737
have a match then we put the next states
into a match. So now, what we have to do

148
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:46,503
is follow the, epsilon transitions from
match. So now, we build another DFS which

149
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:52,434
gives us marks all the states that you
could reach by starting with any of the

150
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:58,727
states in match. and now when we build a
new PC, we'll just set PC to a new, new

151
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:04,223
bag, and put all the marked states for
that search. So, those are all the ones

152
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:09,575
that you could get to via epsilon
transitions right after a match, and put

153
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:15,506
that in the PC. Now. we have a new PC. and
we've r ead the ith, character and we go

154
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:24,078
to the i plus first character, and simply
continue. so, when we're done with all of

155
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:33,605
the text then we can test if we made it to
the accept state. that is, if any of the

156
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:40,733
states in our current set of states is the
accept state, we return true. and if we

157
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:47,288
didn't get to the accept state after all
of that, we return false. A very compact

158
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:53,351
code that takes advantage of our
implementation of reachability for

159
00:16:53,597 --> 00:17:00,958
digraphs in a, a reasonable way to
simulate the operation of an NFA by

160
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:08,869
keeping track of all reachable states. so,
what about the N analysis? Well it's easy

161
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:16,135
to see that the not difficult to see that
if our text is N-character and we have an

162
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:22,727
M-character pattern. the worst that can
happen is that we take time proportional

163
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:29,410
to M times N. and that's just because for
everyone of the characters we have a set

164
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,970
of states, a set of all possible states.
And we iterate through that set of

165
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:43,060
possible states a few times. we even run
DFS on it, but that's linear. and there's

166
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:50,329
the extra point that the number of edges
that we have is less than 3M. No node has

167
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:57,384
more than three edges leaving it. So the
total amount of time for each character is

168
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:01,758
proportional to M and there's
N-characters, so there are any

169
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:07,445
proportional to M times N. So, that's the,
the cost of the simulation. Of course a

170
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:12,913
lot of times, the size of the set of
states is much smaller than that. so in

171
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:19,180
many real world problems, it's closer to
linear. that's NFA simulation.
