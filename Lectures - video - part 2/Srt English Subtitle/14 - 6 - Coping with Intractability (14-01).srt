1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,651
Okay. We're going to finish up by talking
a little bit about different approaches to

2
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:15,347
dealing with needing to solve intractable
problems. this, actually, a lot of

3
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:22,029
different ways to proceed when you run
into an intractable problem. One idea is

4
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:29,035
to exploit it. In fact, an example of
this, a very successful example of this is

5
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:36,183
modern cryptography. People using the
internet for commerce, or for interaction

6
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:42,965
through digital signatures and other
mechanisms are absolutely relying on

7
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:49,807
modern cryptography for security and
privacy. and that's all based on the RSA

8
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:55,601
cryptosystem, or much of it. and it's
based on the idea that multiplying two

9
00:00:55,815 --> 00:01:00,965
N-bit integers is relatively easy. This
and a, brute force multiplication

10
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:06,616
algorithm gets it done in quadratic time
when there's faster ways. So that's

11
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:12,552
polynomial time. So in order to encrypt
something, you need to multiply things,

12
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:18,699
but in order to break something, you would
need to factor things. That's exploiting

13
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:25,760
interactability. Nobody knows a good way
to factor. A factor is not MP complete, by

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,646
the way, not known to be MP complete. So
it doesn't, in fact, not quite as hard as

15
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:39,808
other problems. But still nobody knows a
fast way. So but this is an example of

16
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:47,188
exploiting suspected problems, that's
suspected to be intractable. In fact,

17
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:55,882
there's other ways to make money [UNKNOW
put, put some challenges and go ahead and

18
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:05,713
factor this number towards $30,000. . Some
of these things have been , prices have

19
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:12,642
already been claimed but it may be easier
to go after this than after the, the

20
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:19,901
millionth and actually [UNKNOWN] and
Idilin were just not just but professors

21
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:26,446
at MIT when they came up with this and
they realized that. the important

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,152
commercial potential of this And actually
created a company based on the difficulty

23
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:39,634
of factoring that sold for 2.1 billion
dollars not that long ago. And it's the

24
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:46,712
basis for, internet commerce. so these
possibilities for making a lot of money

25
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:53,120
out of, understanding the difficulty of
computation, are not imaginary. they're

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:01,610
quite real. so, I, talk briefly about the
complexity of fac tors.

27
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:11,023
That's, another problem like, LP is that,
it's current status is what LP was in the

28
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:17,120
70s. we're using it, a lot of people were
doing it we knew that the worst case was

29
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:23,007
of simplex was exponential. we'd like to
classify it, like to know if there's a

30
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:28,474
poly time, nomial time algorithm, but
nobody knew one. And then the big surprise

31
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:34,711
for LP was that Catching came up with a, a
polynomial time algorithm and, and, then,

32
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:40,037
you know, and people went to work. For
factor we're kind of in the same

33
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:47,406
situation. It's NMP. Being as we saw, it's
just a, search problem but. , it's not

34
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:54,355
known or believed to be either NP or NP
complete. But again who knows. so what if

35
00:03:54,355 --> 00:04:01,412
it turns out that P equals NP. so, so that
would mean that now it factors in P and

36
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:08,272
that would . It's not just the math. that
would mean, there'd be an easy way to

37
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:14,718
break the, RSA crypto system which is in
wide use. people could, break codes by,

38
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:20,440
just by factoring. and that, that would
not be a good thing for the modern

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,380
economy. actually, something that
attracted a lot of attention, although

40
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,102
it's almost twenty years ago now. was a
result by Peter Shore that said, that,

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,107
There's a device, not quite a real device,
called a quantum computer. At least one

42
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:47,797
that you can imagine building that solves
factoring in polynomial time. So that

43
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:55,298
raises the question of, do we still
believe the extended Church-Turing thesis.

44
00:04:55,514 --> 00:05:01,420
There are plenty of people that are not so
sure and are working hard on trying to

45
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,045
build devices that might have a big impact
on this kind of theory. well, actually we

46
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:13,807
create, and has created a, a new theory
based on how difficult is it to do things

47
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:20,364
with these sorts of devices. Okay, but in
general, suppose you have a intractable

48
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:26,928
problem, what are you going to do to cope
with it? Well, there's a number of things

49
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:33,401
that people have done really successfully.
so remember what it means to be

50
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:40,175
intractable. so a problem's intractable
if, in, in, in the sense that we don't

51
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:46,232
know a polynomial time problem that's
guaranteed to solve any instance. Now so

52
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:52,071
maybe you can give up on, on, on e of the
three key features of that statement.

53
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:58,195
maybe we don't care if we can solve every
possible instance. Maybe it's only the

54
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:03,821
instances that are gonna arrive in the
real world, arise in the real world that

55
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:11,100
matter. so or maybe you can even simplify
the problem and that's the one that you

56
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,983
really need to solve. So for example, if
you restrict. Satisfiability to have at

57
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:22,677
most two literals per equation, can solve
in linear time. Or even if you just insist

58
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:28,439
that there be at most one of the literals
per equation be not negated. That's called

59
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,516
a Horn-SAT. There's a linear time
algorithm for that. So maybe your problem

60
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:38,798
is you're trying to solve too hard a
problem, and you can come up with a more

61
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,943
special case of the problem that's
actually the one you want to solve that

62
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:50,098
you could solve. So that's definitely one
way to cope with interactability. another

63
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:59,216
thing is optimality. we've been talking
about search problems but this is, this is

64
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:06,975
more a statement about Mm-hm, . But,
optimization problems, we're looking for

65
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:12,203
the best solution or we're looking for a
proximate solutions. where you take away

66
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:17,256
the guarantee that the solution's perfect
in some way. So for example, the traveling

67
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:22,674
sales person problem. People can find ways
to get tours that are close to the best

68
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:28,026
possible tour, but maybe not the best. And
there's many, many other example of this.

69
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:32,783
Where people are looking for good
solutions, without trying to guarantee

70
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:38,003
that they're optimal. And those, maybe
those solutions are very close to optimal,

71
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:42,992
or at least, close enough that you can use
the solution and move on. if you

72
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:47,607
understand the quality of the solution
that you have, that might be, good enough.

73
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:52,334
But and again, the idea of approximation
algorithm and where you really can prove

74
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:59,564
what the quality is. So for example
there's a max three set that guarantees to

75
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:06,820
satisfy seven-eighths of the clauses. And,
actually these algorithm they're really

76
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,709
coming at the fine line between what's
tractable and intractable. And so, for

77
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:18,672
example the, if you want to do 7/8's plus
anything then it mea ns that P equals MP,

78
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:24,412
if you can do that in polynomial time P
equals MP there are lots and lots of

79
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:29,962
amazing results of this sort out there.
but anyway, in practice relaxing

80
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:35,944
condition, that you find the perfect
solution sometimes can get a long way in

81
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:41,948
practice. and then the other thing is
guaranteed polynomial time. We're talking

82
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:48,188
about worse case behavior. but there's
solutions out there. for example, there's

83
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:54,284
a SAT solver that was done here at
Princeton that can solve 10,000 variable

84
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:59,950
SAT instances. Or, as we, as I mentioned,
there's solvers out there for integer

85
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:07,611
linear programming that will solve huge
instances of real world problems. Worst

86
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:12,242
case behaviour may be observed in a real
world, might even be hard to find real

87
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:17,282
world problems. This is, definitely a lot
of room here, to not find solutions that,

88
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,293
might be efficient for the class of
problems, that you want to solve. and I

89
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:28,805
just want to finish up with one of the
most famous NP complete problems which is

90
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:35,317
the so-called Hamilton path problem. and
so that's given a graph, you want to find

91
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:43,274
a path that visits every vertex exactly
once. And simple path, so I can't reuse

92
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:50,374
any edge. So that's a solution to the
Hamilton Path probelem for this graph.

93
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:57,664
Another way to characterize it is a
longest path problem, longest simple path

94
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:05,048
problem in a graph. If you have one of
visit every edge eactly once, that's not

95
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:12,276
difficult. It's actually in the book. But
Hamilton path is NP complete. that's a

96
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:19,413
natural problem that's MP complete. and
actually this is it's empty incomplete,

97
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:26,872
but here's a really simple exponential
time algorithm for computing the Hamilton

98
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:33,412
path. it's just our depth for search
algorithm where we mark nodes and

99
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:40,640
recursively go through all the edges all
the vertices adjacent to the current

100
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,782
vertex. and if they're not marked, go
ahead and visit them recursively, marking

101
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:55,114
all the nodes that we see. The only
difference from the depth first search, is

102
00:10:55,114 --> 00:11:00,593
this thing here. Where, when we're done,
with our recursive call on a node we,

103
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:06,343
unmark it. And what that does is make this
code try a ll possible paths. And there's

104
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:12,499
an exponential number of paths. so, so
define program for doing it for small

105
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:17,881
graphs. But it's going to take exponential
time for big graphs. But the longest path

106
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:23,381
problem is NP complete, and we're going to
finish up with a, a, a song that was

107
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:29,079
composed by a John Hopkins student, one
time when he was having trouble, thinking

108
00:11:29,079 --> 00:13:20,366
about this idea. Woh, oh, oh, oh, find the
longest path. Woh, oh, oh, oh. Find the

109
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:30,809
longest path. Woh, oh, oh, oh. Find the
longest path. If you said P is NP tonight,

110
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
there would still be papers left to write.
I have a weakness, I am addicted to

111
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
completeness. And I kep searching for the
longest path. The algorithm I would like

112
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
to see is of polynomial degree. But it's
elusive, nobody has found conclusive

113
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
evidence that we can find a longest path.
I have been working for so long. I swear

114
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
it's right, and he marks it wrong. Some
how I'll feel sorry when it's done, GPA

115
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
2.1 is more than I hope for. Gary,
Johnson, Karp and other men (and women

116
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
too). Tried to make it order N log N. Am I
a mad fool if I spend my life in Grad

117
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
School, forever following the longest
path. Woh, oh, oh, oh, find the longest

118
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:30,809
path. Woh, oh, oh, oh, find the longest
path. Woh, oh, oh, oh, find the longest

119
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:36,183
path. that's a fine sentiment on which to
end this class on algorithms. I hope that

120
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:41,924
all of you out there are inspired to face
the computational challenges of the future

121
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:47,598
with the algorithms and the concepts that
you've learned in this class. so, that's

122
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:49,360
all. Keep searching, so long.
