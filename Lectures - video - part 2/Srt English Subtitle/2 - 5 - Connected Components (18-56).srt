1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,502
Next we're going to look at a slightly
different graph processing application.

2
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:13,328
But it's a, a, a graph processing
algorithm that's useful in many

3
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:18,535
applications we'll see in a minute.
And slightly different than, depth and

4
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:21,901
breadth first search.
It's called computing connected

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:25,688
components.
Now I mentioned this a little bit when we

6
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:31,043
talked about basic definitions.
So the idea is that if there's a path

7
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:34,406
between two vertices we say they're
connected.

8
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:41,262
And what we want to do is reprocess the
graph that is, build a data type that can

9
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:47,084
answer queries of the form, is V connected
to W in constant time.

10
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:53,906
Now, we want to be able to do that for a
huge, sparse graph of the type that

11
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:59,364
appears in practice.
So we can't use the, if we could use the

12
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:05,550
adjacency matrix data structure, maybe we
could do that but we can't.

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,104
So we're going to build a class that uses
our standard representation, that will

14
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,228
enable clients to find connective
components.

15
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:17,561
It's really interesting to think about
this one.

16
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:23,185
We're getting the job done that we could
get done if we get a huge, sparse matrix.

17
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:28,183
But if we have billions of vertices,
there's no way we can have billions

18
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:32,488
squared in the matrix.
So we have to find another way to do it.

19
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:35,960
So here's the data type that we want to
implement.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,360
So it's called and it's going to the
constructor is going to build the data

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,597
structure that finds the connected
components in the given graph to be able

22
00:01:48,597 --> 00:01:52,618
to efficiently answer these connectivity
queries.

23
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,870
It'll also be able to count the number of
connective components.

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,352
And it also assigns an identifier from
zero to count minus one, that identifies

25
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:08,373
the connective component that every vertex
is in.

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:16,621
Now if you maybe, this sounds a little bit
similar to what we did for the union sign

27
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,517
problem.
So when you union find problem we're,

28
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:26,336
we're taking edges and we wanted to have
queries that, that, well, well union is

29
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:32,229
like adding edge to the graph and then
find is like are these things connected

30
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,511
yet.
Now with union find, we found that we

31
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:39,166
couldn't quite answer the thing in
constant time.

32
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:45,134
Are members are very slow growing on
questions constant practical terms, but

33
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:49,300
not, not really.
So it's less efficient than the algorithm

34
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:53,710
that we're going to talk about cause it
doesn't quite get constant time.

35
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,733
On the other hand in another way it's
better than the algorithm we're going to

36
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,347
talk about because you can either mix the
unions and fines.

37
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:06,207
And in this case, because we're working
with the graph it's like we're taking all

38
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,270
the unions and then we are handling fine
requests.

39
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:14,551
So anyway what we're going to use to
implement this is a depth first search

40
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,844
approach.
So we'll do the depth first search, we'll

41
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:22,380
just keep different data then we did, than
when we were findings paths.

42
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:31,439
So the algorithm is based on the notion
that connection is an equivalence

43
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,834
relation.
So recall an equivalence relation has

44
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:42,840
these three properties.
Every vertex is connected to itself.

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,724
If v is connected to w then w is connected
to v.

46
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:52,065
And if v is connected to w and w to x then
v is connected to x.

47
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:58,376
And those basic operations underlie the
algorithm that we're going to talk about.

48
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:05,578
So the equivalence relation is a, a
general mathematical concept that implies,

49
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:11,809
in graph theory in this case.
And as I already mentioned, in the case of

50
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:16,773
graph, it implies that.
The vertices divide up into connected

51
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:21,121
components which are maximal sets of
connected vertices.

52
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:25,082
So our sample graph has three connected
components.

53
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:31,759
And what we'll do is assign identifiers to
each one of the components in that will

54
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,565
for every vertex.
Give us an identifier number for that

55
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:40,198
vertex.
And that's the data structure then our

56
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:46,131
depth for search is going to built, and
that immediately gives the constant time

57
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:49,320
implementation of the connectivity
queries.

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,303
Given two vertices you look up their ID
and if they're equal, they're in the same

59
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:59,155
connected component, if they're different
they're not.

60
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:05,345
So that's the data structure that we're
going to build it's like a unifying tree,

61
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:08,440
where there's just, all the trees are
flat.

62
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:14,352
So that's where I just said, given
connected components, we can answer

63
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:20,505
queries in constant time.
So here's a big graph, a big grid graph

64
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:29,672
that we use in when we're talking about
union find And turns out that this one's

65
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:36,168
got 63 connected components.
And again when you really think about it

66
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:42,645
it's kind of amazing that we can do this
computation in linear time even for a huge

67
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:46,057
graph.
And it's really important to be able to do

68
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:51,071
so for the very huge graph that we talked
about in so many applications.

69
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,921
If you can process all the edges you can
also find out the connective components

70
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,821
and be set up to answer connect,
connectivity queries.

71
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:04,930
This is a simple algorithm but really it's
ingenious.

72
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,774
Okay.
So let's look at the implementation.

73
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:14,962
So our goal is to petition the vertices
into connected components.

74
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:21,097
So we're going to use DFS in marking.
And so what we're going to do is for a

75
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:25,237
general graph.
For every unmarked vertex, we'rere going

76
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:30,453
to run DFS to find all the vertices that
are connected to that one.

77
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:33,848
They are going to be part of the same
component.

78
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:40,485
So we used the marking to help control the
DFS but also to control the connective

79
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:47,425
components that the vertices that already
have been processed and known to be in a

80
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:52,856
given connective component.
So let's look at a demo to understand how

81
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:57,942
this algorithm works.
So again, we're going to use depth for

82
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:02,742
search and there, summary of depth for
search, divisative vertex, we mark it as

83
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:07,730
visitive and then recursively visit all
the unmarked vertices that are adjacent.

84
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:15,018
So in this case so we'll start we're going
to visit all the vertices in the graph in

85
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:20,859
order to identify the connected component.
So we'll start by visiting zero.

86
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:27,350
To visit zero, we have to check six, two,
one, and five so we start by checking six.

87
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:32,853
We mark it as visited.
So that's entry six in the ray and now

88
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:38,751
we're going to keep this other vertex
indexed array which is the ID the

89
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,569
connected component number.
So or we're saying by putting a zero and

90
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,916
that entry is that six and zero are in the
same connected component.

91
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:56,599
Every vertex that we encounter during the
depth per search from zero we're going to

92
00:07:56,835 --> 00:08:02,661
assign a value of zero.
Okay so, so what do we have to do to visit

93
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:06,778
six.
We have to check zero and then we have to

94
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:14,004
check four so and four is unmarked so
we're going to recourse and visit four.

95
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:18,710
To visit four, we have to check five, five
is unmarked.

96
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:25,082
So we recourse to visit five.
And to visit five we have to check three,

97
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:27,664
four, and zero.
Three is unmarked.

98
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:31,940
This is same depth per search that we did
before.

99
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,481
But now we're just keeping track of the
connective component number, and we're

100
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:42,880
assigning every vertex that we encounter
with the same idea as zero.

101
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:49,764
Okay so, now, we have to visit three.
To visit three we have to check five and

102
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,451
four.
Five was marked and nothing to do.

103
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:56,448
Four was marked, nothing to do.
So we're done with three.

104
00:08:56,655 --> 00:09:01,134
Done with three, we can continue the depth
per search from five.

105
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:04,373
We have to check four and zero.
Four was marked.

106
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,854
Zero was marked.
So we're done.

107
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:11,333
And now we could continue with the depth
per search of four.

108
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,625
We have to check six- three.
Six was marked.

109
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,259
Three was marked and we're done.
And we can,

110
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,077
Now six is done.
And now we can continue with zero and we

111
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:26,796
have to check two.
Check two it's not marked.

112
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:32,122
So we mark it and give it a connected
component number of zero.

113
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:37,785
To visit two, all we do is check zero
which is marked, so we're done.

114
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,420
And then we do the same thing with one,
Unmarked.

115
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,092
So we visit it, I guess assign it zero.
And then visit one.

116
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:49,439
And to do that, we check zero, which is
marked.

117
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:54,321
So we're done with one.
And then, to finish zero we have to check

118
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,738
five.
And that's, marked so we don't have to do

119
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,110
anything.
And we're done with zero.

120
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,936
So, now we're done with the first
connected component.

121
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:10,000
But, we're not done with the whole graph.
So what we want to do is, Go look for, so

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,898
that's a connected component,
corresponding to zero.

123
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:18,879
Now we want, what we want to do is go look
for an unmarked vertex.

124
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:23,933
So, we started at zero and we check one,
two, three, four, five, and six.

125
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,323
And they're all marked.
And so the next unmarked vertex that we

126
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:36,921
find in the graph is seven.
So once we return from the depth first

127
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:42,742
search for zero, we Increment, counter.
Which is our, how many connected

128
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,370
components have we seen.
And now, we're going to assign that number

129
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,690
to everything that's connected to seven on
the depth-first search on seven.

130
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,239
So what do we do to depth per research and
sum we check eight.

131
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,819
8s on the mark.
And so we go visit it.

132
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:02,708
So we assign it, connect the component of
number of one same as seven.

133
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:06,850
And mark it.
And then go ahead and recourse to visit

134
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,362
eight.
We check seven which is marked.

135
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:12,621
So there is nothing to do.
We're done with eight.

136
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:17,578
And then we're done with seven.
So now we're done with all the vertices

137
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,014
that were connected to seven.
We increment our counter of number of

138
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,060
components to two, and look for another
vertex.

139
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,288
So now we check eight, which we already
know is marked, connected to seven.

140
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:34,657
So now nine is unmarked so we're going to
do a DFS from nine.

141
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:40,745
So everybody connected to nine is going to
get assigned a connected component number

142
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:44,040
of two.
So at nine, we have to check eleven and

143
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,285
that was unmarked.
So we visit it.

144
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:50,169
Give it a two.
To visit eleven, we have to check nine,

145
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,270
which is marked.
So nothing to do.

146
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,791
And twelve, which is unmarked.
So we visit it and, give it a number of

147
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,593
two.
To visit twelve, we have to check eleven,

148
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,522
which is marked and nine which is also
marked.

149
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:07,426
And then we're done with twelve.
And then we're done with eleven.

150
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:12,330
And then, to finish doing nine, we have to
check ten and twelve.

151
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,123
Ten is unmarked.
So we mark it and give it a number of two.

152
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:21,838
To visit ten, we check nine which is
marked, so we're done.

153
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:28,438
And then finally, to finish, the DFS.
We check, twelve from nine, and that's

154
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,110
marked.
So we're done with nine.

155
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,532
And now we keep looking.
And we find that, ten, eleven, twelve, are

156
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:39,440
all marked.
So we've completed the.

157
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:43,082
Computation.
And for every vertex we have a connected

158
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:46,530
component number.
And for any given query we can test

159
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,668
whether their in the same connected
component simply by looking up that number

160
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:57,180
and seeing if it's equal.
That's a demo of connected components

161
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,440
computation.
Okay, so here's the code for finding

162
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,624
connected components with DFS.
Which is, another straightforward DFS

163
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:11,335
implementation.
Just like the other one.

164
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:16,724
And it just keeps, slightly, different,
data structure.

165
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:25,785
So, The We keep the marked data structure,
which is the vertices that we visited.

166
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:32,410
And then we keep this vertex index array
ID which gives the identifier, the

167
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,887
component containing V, I think we call it
on the demo.

168
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:43,276
And then a count of the number of
components that we've seen.

169
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:50,469
So the constructor creates, the, marked
array and it creates this idea array.

170
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:55,719
But now the constructor does more work
than a single call on DFS.

171
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,274
What it does is it goes through, this is
the constructor.

172
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:04,520
Goes through every vertex in the array in
the graph.

173
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:10,809
And if it's not marked, it does the DFS.
And that DFS will mark a lot of other

174
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,133
vertices.
But when it's done that's all of those are

175
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:21,344
going to get assigned a value of count.
And we're going to increment count, then

176
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:27,791
go and look for another unmarked vertex.
Anything that wasn't marked by that first

177
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:33,844
DFX, DFS, we'll do a DFS from that one,
and mark all its vertices with the next

178
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:38,865
value for the ID.
So now let's look at the implementation of

179
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:44,898
DFS.
It's recursive array just like the one

180
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:48,963
that we did.
For, for path finding.

181
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:53,651
Except all that we do, when we mark a
vertex.

182
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:59,464
We also simply set its ID to the current
component name.

183
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:07,060
So all the vertices that are discovered in
the same call of DFS have the same ID.

184
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,070
And to visit a vertex you go through all
its adjacent vertices.

185
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:18,040
And any that are not marked you give a
recursive DFS call.

186
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,311
Again, this code is amazingly compact and
elegant.

187
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:29,300
When we're going through the demo step by
step maybe you, you can see that the

188
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,726
underlying computation is actually kind of
complex.

189
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:39,007
But, but, recursion and the
graph-processing API that we set up

190
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,900
provides a compact and easy to understand
implementation.

191
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,176
So that's using DFS to find connector
components and then to return the idea of

192
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:56,088
a given vertex, just look at up in the
array and to return then our components

193
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:02,657
just you can count and then you can build
up the needed connectivity API from those.

194
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:07,110
So that's depth first search to find
connected components.

195
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:14,405
I will just talk briefly about two
applications from scientific applications.

196
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:21,518
So here's an application of sexually
transmitted diseases at a high school.

197
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:27,628
And, simply the vertices are people, blue
are men and pink are women.

198
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:33,979
And you I have an edge between if there
was a contact.

199
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:40,568
And so it's obvious that you're going to
be interested in connective components of

200
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:44,457
this graph.
To be able to properly study sexually

201
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:49,141
transmitted diseases.
These individuals had no contact with

202
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,713
these.
Then, the, whichever one has the disease,

203
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:57,635
maybe it won't spread.
Or if you add a new edge, then maybe you

204
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:02,001
have a problem.
That's just one example of studying the

205
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:08,367
spread of disease.
Here's another example that we use, for,

206
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:14,437
for that's similar to the flood fill
example.

207
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:20,790
And this is processing data from a
scientific experiment.

208
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,836
And in, in this case this image is comes
from a photograph.

209
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:30,986
And the white things are particles that
are moving.

210
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:35,542
And all we get is a image where it's a
grey scale image.

211
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:41,237
And so, what we'll do to do this
processing is, we want to identify the

212
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:47,340
movement of these particles over time.
And the way we do it is build a grid

213
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,849
graph, like the one for the flood fill
application and do an edge connecting two

214
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,290
vertices.
If they're different,

215
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,290
He said their gray scale values is greater
than less than some threshold.

216
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:06,228
And so then if you do that, and then find
the connective components, then you can

217
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:11,351
identify blobs which correspond to real
particles in this simulation.

218
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:17,364
And they do that every frame in a movie,
then you can track moving particles over

219
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,853
time.
So these are maybe fairly high resolution

220
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:24,268
images.
These are graphs with lots and lots of

221
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:30,281
edges, and you need to be able to do this
computation quickly in order to do this

222
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:34,290
scientific experiment.
And we'd use this as an example.

223
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,380
Example in our first year programming
course it is based on computing connected

224
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,588
components using depth-first search.
So that's our third example of a graph

225
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:47,020
processing algorithm.
