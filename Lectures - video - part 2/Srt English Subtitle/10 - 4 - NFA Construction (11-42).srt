1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,657
So the final step in our regular
refreshing pattern matching algorithm is

2
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:12,905
to construct and then determine the thick
finite automaton. So how do we go ahead

3
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:22,651
and do that? and this is an integral part
of the algorithm. but we pretty much have

4
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:28,004
got all the pieces, but really what makes
it intricate is that if, an illustration

5
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:34,638
of what a programming line has to do to
when trying understand your program, what

6
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:40,443
your programming does. What we need to do
is somehow understand what's in the

7
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:46,022
regular expression and then take that
information and use it to build the

8
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:52,172
machine. Now, that's what parson, that's
called parsoning. to try to figure out the

9
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:57,279
structure of your program or regular
expression and then, do something with it.

10
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:03,522
And this is a simple example of that but
useful as well. So the first thing that

11
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:10,254
needs clear what to do. So we're going to
have one state per character as we talked

12
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:16,662
about before, so that's easy to set up.
and then the match transition edges. if a

13
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:22,016
state contains a character in the
alphabet, we just put in a match

14
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:27,288
transition to the next state. and
actually, that's implicit in our

15
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:33,188
algorithm. so now what about other things?
Well, if we have for any parenthesis we

16
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:40,004
find, we'll just put in an epsilon
transition to the next state. so our

17
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:47,628
machines all have that. now closure is one
that you know, has quite a bit of action.

18
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:55,701
so, for every star let's look at the one
that is just a one character closure. So

19
00:01:55,701 --> 00:02:02,787
we have a single character closure. So
this is A star. and, and what we need is

20
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:10,424
epsilon transitions for the star that
allow the machine to go and pick up well,

21
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:16,741
there has, there has to be one, an epsilon
transition that goes out to the star to

22
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:22,761
cover the case, so we have zero matches.
and then after zero, then we want to go

23
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:29,079
back to have as many matches as we want
before taking the sorry, take the match

24
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:35,099
transition. We're going to be able to go
back and match as many as we want before

25
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:43,048
going up to the next. So for star, we have
to add three epsilon transitions. The one

26
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:52,370
that goes if you have a character in I and
a star in I + one , you have to add these

27
00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:01,272
edges going both ways and then an edge out
to the next character for, to get out of

28
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:08,540
the star. And that works also if there's a
closure involving parentheses. If the

29
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,104
character before the star is a parenthesis
then we want to add the same kind of

30
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:19,736
mechanism from the parenthesis, go out and
skip the whole thing to cover the zero

31
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:24,955
match case or go back and match as many
times as we need to match and then

32
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:30,311
finally, go out. So there's three edges
have to be added for each star and defined

33
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:37,945
and well defined what they are. and then
or there's two epsilon transition edges

34
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:45,600
that we have to add. and that is to allow
the machine to skip the first part of the

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,200
expression and do the second or to skip
the, do the first part of the expression

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,542
and skp the second. so if we keep track of
where the left parenthesis is when we end

37
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:03,233
the or operator when we get to the right
parenthesis, we have all the information

38
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:09,376
that we need in order to be able to add
those two edges. so those are the edges

39
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:16,037
that we have to put together to build the
NFA. and the trick is keeping track of the

40
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:21,439
information of where the previous
operators are particularly since

41
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:28,322
parentheses can be nested. but this is not
that difficult to do because we have a

42
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:34,539
mechanism for doing that. how to, to,
remember where the left parentheses are

43
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:42,479
and, and the or and that's to maintain a
push down stack. and so the, the algorithm

44
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:51,850
is to push left parenthesis in or onto the
stack. And then when we hit right

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,654
parenthesis, then we can pop of course the
corresponding left parenthesis and maybe,

46
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:02,776
maybe the or and that gives us all the
information that we need to add the

47
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:08,103
epsilon transition edges and so the stack
takes care of the nesting of the

48
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:13,771
parenthesis. and when you think about it,
this is a very natural mechanism to use

49
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:20,190
very similar to the early programs that we
wrote using Dexter's algorithms for medic

50
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,518
expressions. so let's look at a demo and
you'll see how that works. So we're going

51
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:32,716
to build the machine corresponding to this
regular expression and it's the one that

52
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:39,698
we've been working with. And so what we do
is just go from left to right through the

53
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:46,323
regular expression and , take the
appropriate action, for each character. So

54
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:52,121
for left parenthesis. there's always an
epsilon transition from, left parenthesis

55
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:56,865
to the next state. and then the other
thing is, if you remember that last

56
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:01,610
parenthesis on the push down stack. So we
put the index zero onto the stack. so now

57
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:07,941
we got another left parenthesis again, we
put the epsilon transition on, and we push

58
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:14,400
that one onto the stack. so now, if we
have an alphabet symbol what we need to do

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,919
is add the match transition to the next
state. And then there's a couple ways to

60
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,135
this, but one easy way, in this case, is
to just look for the star and if you see

61
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:33,655
that the next one is a star then you've
got everything you need for the epsilon

62
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:40,250
transitions. So, in this case the next one
is a star so we'll add those epsilon

63
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,776
transitions from the from two to three and
from three to two.

64
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:54,712
And adding epsilon transitions, that's
just, adding edges to the phi graph. then

65
00:06:54,712 --> 00:07:00,237
with closure that just takes us to the
next state and we took care of the other

66
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:05,555
two earlier. now we have an alphabet
symbol, that's the B, so we just put in

67
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:11,633
the transition to the next state. Now we
have an or. All we do for an or is put it

68
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:17,365
on the stack. now it's got for A, we got
the match transition, for C, we got the

69
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:23,814
match transition. and now we have the
first right parenthesis. so this right

70
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:29,572
parenthesis so one thing we, the first
thing we do is an epsilon period just to

71
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:35,799
get it over to the next state. but then we
go to the put down stack and we pop. and

72
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:42,045
if the thing at the top of the stack is an
or that's one thing, piece information

73
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:47,533
that we need. the other piece of
information we need is the position of the

74
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:53,594
corresponding left parenthesis and that'll
be the next thing on the stack. So we add

75
00:07:53,594 --> 00:08:00,003
the transition we pop the or off the stack
and we pop the or on and off the stack and

76
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:05,924
that gives us the information that we need
to put in the epsilon transition. We're at

77
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:09,617
stage eight.
We put one from the or to eight, and then

78
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:15,538
we put one from the one to the or + one.
There's the, that's what we need to do.

79
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:22,483
and, look for a star the same way as we
did for one character. now in this case we

80
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:30,435
have a no star. So we just do the finite
alphabet symbol and we add the match

81
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:37,424
transition. and now we have the right
parenthesis and so we pop the

82
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:44,366
corresponding left parenthesis. and it's
not an or. so in this case you know,

83
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:49,866
there's nothing to do except do the
epsilon transition to the accept state. so

84
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:56,269
that's the process for each character in
the regular expression, it's well defined

85
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:03,472
what we do. left parenthesis and or we put
onto the stack characters we do the match

86
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:09,147
transitions and right parenthesis we do a
pop and if it's an or, put a numeric

87
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:16,205
transitions. otherwise we do the look at
to check for the star. and that's the demo

88
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:21,931
of the construction for nondeterministic
finite state of phenomena. So, it's

89
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:28,945
actually a remarkably simple process. we
figured out what to do with each character

90
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:35,706
in the regular expression and this is the
second part of the regular expression

91
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:41,199
pattern-matching algorithm, which is
constructing the NFA. And again it's a

92
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:50,393
remarkably little code. So it's a routine
that builds the epsilon transition. this

93
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:59,970
is a part of the NFA. So it's got the
regular expression . yes, a useless

94
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,762
variable to refer to. and it's going to
build a new diagraph with one state, one

95
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:16,432
extra state, the accept state M+11 if the
rate description has M characters. so, the

96
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:23,690
and then we maintain a stack which is just
integers. and for every character in a

97
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,176
regular expression we do the processing
that we just described. if it's a left

98
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:38,422
parenthesis or an or we just put it on to
the stack. and that's it. if it's a right

99
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:45,371
parenthesis then we pop. If that pop is an
or, then we put in the two edges to skip

100
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:51,634
the or. and otherwise, we look ahead and
do the closure exactly as described. If

101
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:58,378
it's any one of the metal symbols, we just
put in a next line transition to the next

102
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:04,272
edge. And then a remarkably little code to
go ahead and construct the NFA from a

103
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:09,613
given regular expression. and so, the
final step is the analysis that's going to

104
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:15,978
take time and space proportional to M. and
that's immediate, because for every

105
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:21,771
character we do most of two stack
operations and add at most three epsilon

106
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:28,065
transitions. And, this is a generous upper
bound, time and space proportional to the

107
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:33,501
number of characters in the regular
expression. So that's how we get the NFA
