1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,642
To get started, we're going to look at a
general scheme for solving max-flow

2
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:10,110
min-cut problems, known as the
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,712
Dates back to the 1950s.
And the idea is to start with no flow

4
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:22,232
anywhere.
So, we initialize all edges to have

5
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:28,191
capacity zero.
And then find any path from s to t, so

6
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:33,020
that you can increase the flow along that
path.

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,714
Now, the simplest case is when the edges
all go in the same direction from source

8
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:42,300
to target.
We'll look at the other case in a minute.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,721
In that case, so there is a path, and this
is the general algorithm that works for

10
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:53,920
any path and if there's a path from s to
t, go ahead and find it.

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,033
And if there's capacity left in each one
of the edges, if none of them were full,

12
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:04,298
then what we want to do is augment the
flow along that path.

13
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,924
So we put as much flow as we can through
that path.

14
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,402
In this case, we can put ten units of flow
through each path.

15
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:18,231
Through each edge, there's room to put
ten, and two of the edges fill up in that

16
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:23,350
case but we've increased the flow in the
network by ten in that case.

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,562
And the algorithm is just, continuing that
way, finding a path.

18
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:33,856
So here's another path.
And this one also the edges all flow from

19
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:37,736
source to target.
And in this case again, we can add ten

20
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:42,041
more units a flow cuz the last edge only
has capacity ten.

21
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:48,114
So load up those edges with that flow, and
now, we've got twenty units a flow in the

22
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:51,502
network.
Notice, when we augment along in edge,

23
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:57,501
we're preserving the vertex equilibrium,
local equilibrium at a vertex property.

24
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:02,160
We're putting some flow in and taking the
same amount of flow out.

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,228
So, here's another augmenting path.
Now, this one has what's called a backward

26
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:13,496
edge.
So notice that if, the path going from s

27
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:20,442
to t goes backwards along that edge,
And the idea is, that you can augment flow

28
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:25,430
through the whole network by removing flow
in that path.

29
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,105
That is, if we add five units of flow from
s to this vertex, and five units of flow

30
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:36,780
from s to this vertex, then what we can do
is remove five units of flow along this

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,963
edge.
That's to preserve the local equilibrium.

32
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:44,600
Essentially, that five units of flow gets
transferred right through.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,820
After we remove five units and we add five
here.

34
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,190
That's five coming in,
There's still ten going out.

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,825
And then for the forward edges, we add the
flow.

36
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:05,244
That is, we can augment the flow along an
augmenting path, by adding flow to forward

37
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:08,880
edges and subtracting flow from backward
edges.

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,184
The maximum amount of flow that we can
push through is the remaining capacity in

39
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,785
forward edges and the amount of flow in
backward edges.

40
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:23,090
You can't remove more flow than is there.
In this case, we can augment the flow in

41
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,554
the network by five.
That, fills up the first edge.

42
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:30,493
And so now we've got 25 units of flow in
the network.

43
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:35,843
And again, the idea of removing flow from
a backward edge is very simple.

44
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:41,713
It's just a way to ensure that the local
equilibrium conditions always remains

45
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:48,657
satisfied as we're moving along the path.
In this case there's one more augmenting

46
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:59,384
path.
Okay. And that's, forward, forward,

47
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:04,374
forward, forward, backwards along that one
again and then forward, forward.

48
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:09,925
So, and then what's the maximum amount
that we can push through in this case,

49
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:16,180
this one has got five in it and it's got a
capacity of eight so we can put three more

50
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,404
units of flow through this network.
And we get a now we have 28 units of flow

51
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:28,665
going through the network.
And the algorithm terminates when there's

52
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:32,841
no way to find an augmenting path from s
to t.

53
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:38,731
And what's that mean?
That means that every augmenting path,

54
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:46,030
Every path from s to t contains either a
full forward edge or an empty backwards

55
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,176
edge.
We can't put more flow through a forward

56
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:55,402
edge and we can't remove flow from an
empty backward edge.

57
00:04:55,402 --> 00:05:01,350
So when there's no more augmenting paths,
the algorithm terminates.

58
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,282
And so that's the algorithm.
We start with no flow.

59
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:11,161
As long as there is an augmenting path,
We, we find that path and look through the

60
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:16,281
path to find the amount, the, amount
capacit left in the most full forward edge

61
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:20,318
and the amount of flow left in the most
empty back edge.

62
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,067
And we increase the flow in the path by
that amount.

63
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:28,105
And if we can't find an augmenting path,
then we're done.

64
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:33,801
Now there's a few questions about this.
So that solves the maximum flow problem.

65
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,190
We have to look at how to compute and
min-cut.

66
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,768
We have to figure out a way to find an
augmenting path.

67
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:46,047
That's not to hard.
That's similar to many other graph

68
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:49,650
processing problems that we have already
solved.

69
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,904
And we have to, ensure that or at least
show that it always computes a max-flow.

70
00:05:56,316 --> 00:06:00,049
and, there's even a question of does it
actually terminate?

71
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:06,132
Maybe you could get stuck in some kind of
situation where it removes flow on an edge

72
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:12,076
in one path and, adds it in another, and
so, even analyzing how many times it does

73
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:15,601
augmentation, is actually not so
straightforward.

74
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:21,891
So we'll take a look, at these questions.
That's the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the

75
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,380
general scheme for solving nax-flow.
