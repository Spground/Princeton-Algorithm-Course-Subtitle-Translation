1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:09,365
So finally, we're going to take a look at
the implications of having negative

2
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:17,204
weights in directed weighted graphs.
So the first thing to notice is that the

3
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:23,687
easy solutions don't work at all.
Dijkstra's algorithm just doesn't work in

4
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:27,010
the presence of, presence of negative
weights.

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,768
So say, this weight from two to three is
-nine.

6
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:37,349
What Dijkstra's algorithm will do is just
immediately select vertex three and never

7
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:41,998
revisit that decision.
Saying the shortest way to get from zero

8
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:45,323
to three is, is,
Is to take this edge of three which has

9
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:48,774
weight two.
But the actual shortest path goes over to

10
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:53,005
four and then over to one and down to two
for a weight of ten.

11
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:57,414
And then a -nine makes it one.
So there's a way to get from, zero to

12
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:01,665
three with a weight path weight just one.
Because of the -nine.

13
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:06,763
But Dijkstra's algorithm won't find that.
So that's not going to work and you might

14
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:12,393
think, well, why don't we just make all
the weights positive by adding nine to

15
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:16,116
everything.
Well, that's not going to work because a

16
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:22,450
longer path will have nine added to it a
lot of times, so its just not any relation

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:28,048
between shortest paths in this graph and
shortest paths in that graph.

18
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:34,751
So, those easy attempts, just don't work
for dealing with, negative weights, in

19
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:39,023
general graphs.
So the conclusion is we need some

20
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:44,786
different algorithm and the top logical
sort one isn't going to work cuz the graph

21
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:49,217
might have a cycle in it, so there's no
topological sort so we needs some

22
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:55,839
different algorithm.
And the main thing to think about in terms

23
00:01:55,839 --> 00:02:01,347
of weighted directed graphs, that might
have cycles,

24
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:07,399
Is that you can have this situation called
a negative cycle.

25
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:15,277
This is a graph, it all looks fine.
It's just got this one negative edge from

26
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:22,001
five to four of weight -0.66.
And these other ones are 0.37 + 0.28. So

27
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:27,685
that's +0.65.
But if you go from five to four to seven

28
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:34,420
to five, Then the distance around that is
-0.01.

29
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,303
And if we're trying to find, say a
shortest path from zero to six, Well as

30
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:46,070
soon as you hit this cycle if you want
really want the shortest path, what you

31
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,876
could do is spin around this well an
infinite number of times.

32
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:56,791
You could make the path a short as you
want, if you hit an infinite, if you hit a

33
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,597
negative cycle.
So, negative cycles definitely can get in

34
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:05,737
the way of trying to solve the shortest
path problem.

35
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:14,886
It make somewhat specified.
So, the first thing is if there's no

36
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:21,112
negative cycles, then there's a shortest
path tree, and if there's a shortest path

37
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:27,492
tree, there's no negative cycles assuming
that you can actually get to the vertices.

38
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:33,948
So what we'll want is graphs that have no
negative cycles and then we can work with

39
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:38,656
those.
And is an algorithm an old algorithm known

40
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:43,087
as the Bellman-Ford algorithm that does
the job.

41
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:50,473
It's only slightly more specific than the
generic algorithm that we gave before.

42
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:57,951
It just says so if you have V vertices,
for just V times all you do is go through

43
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:02,290
all the edges in the graph and relax each
edge.

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,277
So you make V passes through relaxing all
the edges in the graph.

45
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:13,511
And that's, an algorithm that finds
shortest paths, in graphs that don't have

46
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:18,572
any negative cycles.
If there's a negative cycle, it, you know,

47
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:24,513
we'll talk about what happens in a minute.
So lets look at that one in terms of a

48
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:29,743
demo.
So we'll just take the list of edges in

49
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:34,950
the graph it could be in any order, and
we'll just relax them all.

50
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,913
So to start out, we, set the distance to
the source zero and everybody else's

51
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:49,011
distance, infinity as usual.
And then here's the list of edges.

52
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:55,760
So we'll relax In this case, we start out
with the edges sort of in the order that

53
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,710
you'd get em' by walking through the whole
graph so you get all the edges associated

54
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,910
with each vertex together.
So relax zero, one, relax zero, four,

55
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,670
relax zero, seven, that's kind of the way
Dijkstra would start out.

56
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,076
And then, we go ahead and relax the edges
that, come out from one, so one, two takes

57
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:25,205
to, two for the first time, one, three
takes us to three for the first time.

58
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:29,658
One, seven is no help so we ignore it.
Now we relax.

59
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:34,313
Sorry, went too far.
Two, three and two, six and those, that

60
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:42,614
one takes us to six for the first time.
And now three, six that does not give us a

61
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:48,673
better way to six so we ignore it.
Now we go to four, five that takes us to

62
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:54,185
five for the first time.
Four, six well we could get to four and

63
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:59,970
nine and twenty to six so that's no help.
Four, five that's no help.

64
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,186
Now we do the ones from five, five, two
that's going to give a better way to two

65
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:11,618
so we've improved that.
And five, six is going to give a better

66
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:14,596
way to six.
Now, seven, five that's no help.

67
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:18,721
And seven, two is no help.
So we've completed the first paths.

68
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:22,996
And now we're just gonna go through and
relax all the edges again.

69
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:28,307
Now a lot of them are really just what we
did before so they're not going to improve

70
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:32,905
anything, like the ones at the beginning
are not gonna improve anything.

71
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,740
But before too long so still no
improvement.

72
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,548
But here, now the second time we relax
two, three we have it gives us a better

73
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:48,316
way to get to three.
In, for the first path that didn't help us

74
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:53,519
but the second path we relax two, three to
get us to three and seventeen.

75
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:59,162
Now that's going to change things for
three, If we had already been through

76
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:04,635
three it wouldn't, wouldn't matter.
In this, in this, we'd take another path

77
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:10,258
to deal with, but in this case, we're
going to be coming through three later.

78
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,707
And, there's another, two to six gets
better.

79
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:18,281
Then three to six well, two to six beat it
so it doesn't help.

80
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:23,080
And now I think, there's nothing else that
helps in this example.

81
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,937
And in fact, there's no further changes.
Once we have the shortest path stream,

82
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:36,623
which, we know from this example, because
it's similar to one we did before then

83
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:42,721
there's going to be no, no changes to it.
You're not going to find any edges that

84
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:47,423
successfully relax.
And so, go through and, try them all, and

85
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:53,448
in the end we have a shortest path stream.
So that is an example of a Bellman-Ford

86
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:59,288
algorithm, on a simple, simple graph.
Here's the visualization of the

87
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:03,527
Bellman-Ford algorithm running on a bigger
graph.

88
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:09,308
And here's what it looks like after four
passes, seven, ten, thirteen.

89
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:16,245
And this graph has 100 something vertices.
And it finds the tree in a relatively

90
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:21,868
small number of passes.
And we'll talk about the performance in a

91
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:26,453
second of.
One thing is to be sure that the algorithm

92
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:30,520
works.
And there's a couple of ways to prove it.

93
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:38,639
And again, the reason the proof has to be
done with care is that there could be

94
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,881
edges with negative weights but no
negative cycles.

95
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:51,692
The idea of the proof is that after you've
done the i for pass, you've found the

96
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:59,504
shortest path containing at most i edges.
And, and we'll leave that proof for the

97
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:03,089
book.
Now there is a couple of ways to improve

98
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:10,490
the Bellman-Ford algorithm in practice.
And, the most important one is that if you

99
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,157
didn't change the distance to a vertex
during one pass,

100
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:17,903
Then you don't have to worry about it in
the next pass.

101
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:21,650
You don't have to worry about it, it's
edges in the next pass.

102
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:28,636
And so, what we do in practice, is if you
just maintain a queue of the vertices that

103
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:34,480
we found shorter paths to, in each path.
We want to make sure that we keep, at

104
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,311
most, one copy of each vertex on the
queue.

105
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:42,972
Otherwise, you could wind up with
situations where, the, queue, size of the

106
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:47,218
queue, blows up.
But that's easy to do, with, a vertex

107
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:53,202
index array to keep track of that.
And so, in the worst case, you could have

108
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:59,865
all the vertices on the queue for, And
then therefore all the edges relaxed, in

109
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:05,484
every one of the V passes.
But in practice not too many vertices

110
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:10,761
really get relaxed.
So, this is a, a quick summary of the

111
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:17,161
algorithms that we've looked for, for,
shortest paths, And, we didn't do the code

112
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,766
for Bellman-Ford.
We've done enough code today.

113
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:26,210
It's quite simple code that you'll find in
the book over on the book site.

114
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:32,540
So, probably the simplest algorithm is
when there are no directed cycles.

115
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:38,324
And that's when we just topologically sort
the vertices and then go through that list

116
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:41,216
and relax every edge.
So that's linear time.

117
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:44,612
You relax all the edges in the graph and
that's it.

118
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,944
And that works even if there are negative
weights.

119
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:53,414
If there's no negative weights but there
maybe cycles, then Dijkstra's algorithm

120
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,433
works.
And then we looked at E log V algorithms

121
00:10:56,433 --> 00:11:00,520
which are slightly faster depending on
what kind of heap you use.

122
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:07,042
The Bellman-Ford algorithm which works
with negative weights as long as it's no

123
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:13,791
negative cycles it's if, if you do the q
you can get the in, in practice it turns

124
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,252
out to be linear time for the times of
graphs that arise in practice.

125
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:25,850
Although in principle the worst case it
could be E times V which is much to slow.

126
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:29,246
So, directed cycles make the problem
harder.

127
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:32,504
You need a Dijkstra instead of top logical
sort.

128
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:36,525
Negative weights definitely make the
problem harder.

129
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:41,793
Because you might need, to, get the worst
case of Bellman-Ford.

130
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:47,339
And negative cycles, in the presence of
negative cycles, it actually makes the

131
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,844
problem intractable.
And we'll talk about that a little bit at

132
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,518
the end of the course.
One thing that you can do with the

133
00:11:56,748 --> 00:12:02,660
Bellman-Ford algorithm is to at least
find, find out if there's a negative

134
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,269
cycle.
In one practical reason to do that is

135
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:12,641
maybe it has something to do with
something else specified in the problem.

136
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:19,245
And so if you can detect a negative cycle
and deal with it that would be useful.

137
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:25,157
And we'll look at another important
practical reason for finding negative

138
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:30,239
cycles in just a second.
So anyway, since its a useful thing to do

139
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:37,161
we're going to add two methods to the API.
And that is does the graph have a negative

140
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:42,389
cycle and in an interval?
If it does have a negative cycle please

141
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,881
give it to me.
So for this graph, it would return true.

142
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:53,420
And then it would give an iterable that
would have these three edges that give me

143
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,651
the negative cycle.
So, the, observation or the way to find a

144
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:04,614
negative cycle is to realize that what
will happen with a Bellman-Ford algorithm

145
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:10,307
if there's a negative cycle is that it'll
every, every path through, it'll basically

146
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:14,278
go around the cycle.
Well not every pass in the, in the whole

147
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,647
length in the cycle.
It'll get stuck in a loop going around the

148
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:24,538
cycle depending on the order of vertices.
And it'll update and just get stuck going

149
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:28,836
around the, around the cycle.
So by testing what happens after

150
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:34,213
Bellman-Ford is done, even if there's
negative cycles present, we can find the

151
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:39,785
negative cycles and that, in fact,
If some vertex is updated in the last

152
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:45,650
phase of the Bellman-Ford algorithm then
there's a negative cycle.

153
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,237
And not only that.
Edge 2v is the last edge, on that cycle.

154
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:55,141
That's the way you got to v.
And you can trace back to find the cycle.

155
00:13:55,141 --> 00:14:01,536
So just run the Bellman-Ford algorithm and
if some vertex gets, get updated, the last

156
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:05,090
time through it means there's a negative
cycle.

157
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:10,839
In practice actually, you don't have to
wait till the last phase.

158
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,949
You can check these two entries for
negative cycles, more frequently.

159
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:21,621
But anyway, it's possible to find a
negative cycle.

160
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:27,730
And let's look at an application.
This is an application that it really

161
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,750
motives some people to understand the
shortest paths to algorithms.

162
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:42,165
And the idea is currency exchange.
And so these are typical numbers that you

163
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:49,147
might see in a newspaper table, or
nowadays in an app on your mobile device

164
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:54,698
that gives the exchange rates for various
currencies.

165
00:14:54,966 --> 00:15:02,197
So to convert a dollar to euros using
factor of points 0.741, I compute Euros

166
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:05,273
too, Great Britain pounds, 0.888, and so
forth.

167
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:08,349
So this table is a table of exchange
rates.

168
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:12,570
And the problem is, is there an arbitrage
opportunity?

169
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,273
So what is an arbitrage.
Well arbitrage is when just by making

170
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:27,111
exchanges according to the legal rates in
the table you can make money.

171
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:32,681
So say we had a $1000.
And then these are the going rates.

172
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,317
Well we can convert that $1000 into 741
Euros.

173
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:45,172
So now, if we take those 71 Euros and
convert them into Canadian dollars it

174
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:50,200
works out that we get 1,012.206 Canadian
dollars.

175
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,217
And if we take those Canadian dollars and
convert them back to U.S.

176
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:04,750
Dollars, it works out that we have $1,007.
Well that's arbitrage and that's

177
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,229
interesting.
If we could go ahead and do for well let

178
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:15,512
say $10,000 then would make $70 on the
deal or a $100,000 would make $700 or

179
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:22,484
maybe a million dollars would make $7,000
or maybe a billion would make $7,000,000.

180
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:28,079
No reason to stop there.
With arbitrage opportunity you're making

181
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,416
money off the system.
So of course there's intense interest in

182
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:39,700
looking for opportunities like this.
Course in modern financial market.

183
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,134
It's there's many more things that you can
trade than currencies.

184
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:50,069
And these tables are big and complex.
And the market is suppose to take care of

185
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:55,351
eliminating these opportunities.
But if you are using a computer and you've

186
00:16:55,351 --> 00:17:01,155
got a fast algorithm for finding negative
cycles in directed graphs then maybe you

187
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:05,590
can find the opportunity and take
advantage of it before the market.

188
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:13,061
So let's look at how it works.
What we do is again model the situation

189
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:19,254
with a graph.
So we're going to have a vertex for every

190
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:23,283
currency.
And then on the edge corresponding to

191
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:29,247
every transaction or every entry in the
table so this is actually a complete

192
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:33,739
directed graph.
And the weight is equal to the exchange

193
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,915
rate.
And what we are trying to find is a

194
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:41,950
directed cycle whose product of edge
weights is greater than one.

195
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:48,618
So that doesn't look like a shortest path
problem although it's close.

196
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:55,462
And actually it's very close.
To convert this to a shortest path problem

197
00:17:55,725 --> 00:18:04,110
what we want to do is just take logs.
If instead of using the exchange rate, we

198
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:12,014
take minus the log of the exchange rate.
And then multiplying turns to addition for

199
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:15,720
looking for multiplying the exchange
rates.

200
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:21,656
That's the same as summing the logs.
And, we took minus log it means that what

201
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:26,340
we're looking for when we're trying to
find products bigger than one.

202
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,647
We're looking for a directed cycle whose
sum of edge weights is less than zero.

203
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:39,032
Find a directed cycle whose sum of edge
weights is less than zero in a complete

204
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:42,647
digraph.
That's the negative cycle detection

205
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:49,186
problem, and we just saw that, we can, do
that with the, Bellman-Ford algorithm.

206
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:56,109
And again, in a huge, directed graph in a
modern trading situation, that's an

207
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:01,390
extraordinarily valuable algorithm, and
you can believe that you know,

208
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,703
There are people out there running these
algorithms in order to detect and take

209
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:11,585
advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
And if you don't have a fast algorithm, if

210
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:16,344
you're using a slow one it'll be gone
before you can take advantage of it.

211
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:21,227
That's a fine example of the value of
building efficient algorithm for a

212
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,970
practical problem.
So here's our summary of short as fast

213
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,139
today.
We've seen some great, classic algorithms

214
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,444
that are, important and extraordinarily
useful.

215
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:37,446
First one is Dijkstra's algorithm which
is, a fine, efficient workhorse algorithm

216
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:42,706
that you see used, every day.
And it's a, a grass search algorithm that

217
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:48,911
is, similar to, Prim's, depth for search
and rep for search that we've seen before

218
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:54,860
and we'll see again if the graphs are,
have no cycles which is a situation that

219
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,735
arises in several important applications.
We can do better than Dykstra's algorithm.

220
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:04,699
It's easier.
And also, negative weights are no problem,

221
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:10,271
which enables us to solve scheduling
problems in other examples If there's

222
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:15,701
negative weights and negative cycles we
can detect negative cycles.

223
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:20,684
And if there aren't any negative cycles,
we can find shortest paths.

224
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,040
In, the general problem is intractable,
and we'll come back to that.

225
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:31,684
But the key point that I want people to
remember from today's lecture is that

226
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:37,328
shortest path is our first real example of
a general problem solving model where

227
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:42,694
there's a lot of important practical
problems that we cast solve as shortest

228
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:46,387
path problems.
Number one and number two we have fast

229
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:52,101
solutions to those problems, with these
classic algorithms that we've talked about
