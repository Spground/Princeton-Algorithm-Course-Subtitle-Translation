1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,109
That's another very important reason to
use reductions. and that gets us closer to

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:14,000
our goal of being able to classify the
difficulty of problems, and that's to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,403
establish lower bounds. so let's take a
look at that. So, what we want to do is

4
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:25,290
come up with a proof that a problem
requires a certain number of computational

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,326
steps. and we had an example of that for
sorting. We showed in the de, decision

6
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:37,660
tree model, any compare based sorting
algorithm has to use at least at least N

7
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:43,353
log N and compares in the worst case. And
we show that be showing that no matter

8
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:48,680
what the algorithm is, it has to
distinguish between all the possible cases

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,795
of sorting. And that led us to in fact, a
tree that has N factorial leaves on the

10
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:59,429
bottom. And the height of the tree has got
to be at least log of that, which is N log

11
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,050
N. And you can go back to the sorting
lecture and look at that. now that's a

12
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:12,179
complicated argument that certainly took
you a little while to understand. and, in

13
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:17,832
general, it's extremely different,
difficult to establish lower bounds

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,923
because it's generally requires a
complicated argument like that. You have

15
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:27,771
to be arguing about all possible
algorithms and that's very often tough to

16
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:33,201
do. Initially, there was a lot of optimism
that we would be able to have lower bounds

17
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:38,307
as researchers worked more and more. And
we'd be able to classify problems. This

18
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:43,672
actually worked out pretty difficult to
get non-trivial lower bounds for all kinds

19
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:49,026
of computational problems where people
thought it would be easy. But the good

20
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:57,447
news is that reduction allows us to take
the ones that we have and spread the lower

21
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:06,618
bound. so, for, if we can reduce sorting
to a new problem and, without too high a

22
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:14,322
cost of reduction, that gives us an N log
N lower bound on that problem. So, let's

23
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:21,099
see how that works. so we have to make
sure the cost of the reduction is not

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,499
high, that's key. so, and actually, most
of the time, like in the examples that

25
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:33,215
we've looked at, we used linear time
reductions. So, that is we only use a

26
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:39,698
constant number of calls to Y. and we use
just a linea r number of steps, so usually

27
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:45,343
we're going through everything in the
input and output to do some kind of

28
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:51,750
conversion, and that's what we've done in
all the examples that we've seen so far.

29
00:02:52,304 --> 00:03:02,315
so, then the idea is, so if there's a
lower bound for X, and you reduce X to Y,

30
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:08,080
that establishes a lower bound than Y,
right? So why is that? If I could solve

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,990
for Y more quickly, then I could use the
reduction to solve X more quickly. so if I

32
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,331
have a reduction from X to Y and there's a
lower bond of N log N and X, I can't have

33
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:26,169
a linear logarithm on Y. Because if I did
and I have a linear time reduction, that

34
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:31,657
would give me a linear time algorithm for
X. Same way if I have a lower bound of n

35
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:36,783
squared for X, I can't have an N login
algorithm for Y. Because if I, if I did,

36
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:42,681
since I reduced X to Y, then that would
give me linear time algorithm for Y. So,

37
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:48,439
the reduction allows us to propagate the
lower bound. If I could solve Y, then I

38
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,776
could easily solve X but I know I can't
easily solve X, so therefore I can't

39
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:59,464
easily solve Y. It's a very powerful
technique and really where most of our

40
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:07,571
lower bounds comes from. So, just for an
example, let's look at lower bound for the

41
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:15,986
convex hull algorithm. and it's again,
convex hull certainly don't seem so

42
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:25,420
related but it's actually the case that in
any algorithm for convex hull is going to

43
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:31,746
take N log N. And so we start with a more
general statement about sorting. use the

44
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:38,071
so-called quadratic decision tree model.
and this is just a detail about the model

45
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:44,110
of computation that makes the idea of
comparing a serving algorithm to a, a

46
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,219
convex hull algorithm. It makes, it makes
them both use the same operation. So quad,

47
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:56,258
quadratic decision tree you get not just
these comparisons, but you can use tests

48
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:02,409
like this the, the product of the
difference of two numbers. are they less

49
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:08,630
than zero or not? and those are the basic
kinds of operations that you're going to

50
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,399
use in the in the geometric algorithms.
And so, the proposition is that under this

51
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,466
model, sorting linear time reduces to
convex hull. so that says, if I can com

52
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:30,272
pute the convex hull, then I can sort.
since I can't sort faster than N log N, I

53
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:36,665
can't do convex hull faster than N log N.
and the proof is not terribly difficult

54
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:42,486
but the implication is really important.
So, convex hull algorithms it was just

55
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:47,661
based on that idea, am I making the right
turn? that's called a CCW test in

56
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:52,836
computational geometry. I have three
points, and going from first to second to

57
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:58,334
third, is that a count, counterclockwise
turn? and then, you can implement that

58
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:04,091
test with these kind of quadratic things.
It's just testing the slopes of two lines

59
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:12,454
and comparing them. So, it's kind of like
a comparison. and, and the implication of

60
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:17,918
the fact that sorting reuses a convex hull
means that you can't solve a convex hull

61
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,250
fast. and so how do we do the reduction
between sorting and convex hull? and

62
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,953
again, the, I have a sorting instance, I
have some numbers to sort. and what I want

63
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:34,874
to do is create a convex hull instance
that gives me sort. Well, all we do is we

64
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:41,245
take the numbers that were supposed to be
sorted and we convert them to points on a

65
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:47,465
parabola. so we just take X1 and X1
squared, and X2 and X2 squared and like

66
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:53,611
that. Those are points parabola. now,
there's no points and, and we give that to

67
00:06:53,611 --> 00:07:00,083
the convex hull algorithm. Now, all of
those points are on the convex hull. in a

68
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:06,843
convex hull algorithm, its supposed to
return on in clockwise order. and you can

69
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:13,400
see with just finding the smallest that
gives us the points in sorted order. So

70
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,538
the convex hull algorithm does its job.
However, it does it we can take the

71
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:24,009
solution to the convex hull algorithm, and
get a solution to the sorting algorithm.

72
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,614
Sorting reduces the convex hull. therefore
our convex hull can't be easy cuz that

73
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:35,286
would make sorting easy. this kind of
thinking is really, is really profound and

74
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:40,691
it has really done a lot to enhance our
understanding of the difficulty of

75
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:45,235
different algorithmic problems. so,
that's, that's the proof that I just

76
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:50,568
explained. this parabola thing is
definitely going to be convex and all the

77
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:56,186
things are on the hull, so we just get the
po int that's got the most negative X

78
00:07:56,186 --> 00:08:02,665
coordinate and you've got the integers in
order. so establishing lower bounds

79
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:08,694
through reduction is really important. we
have a big convex hull problem to solve

80
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:14,308
and, and we're wondering, do we have a
linear time algorithm for this? It's a

81
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:19,921
quite natural thing to wonder. and so how
are you going to convince yourself that

82
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:24,980
there's no linear time convex hull
algorithm? one thing you can do, and

83
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,365
believe me, a lot of people did this, is
just try to find a linear time algorithm.

84
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:35,816
Keep working at it, keep working at it.
you're going to use algorithms that are

85
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:40,942
based on this simple kind of comparison
between points. It doesn't seem like it

86
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:45,743
should take N log N, it seems like we
should be able to find a linear time

87
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:51,259
algorithm. and that's the hard way. The
easy way is to know that reduction from

88
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,514
sorting, and that means there's no point
in to try to put in our effort to try to

89
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,575
improve on the Graham scan. Graham scan
gets it done in N log N. We can't do

90
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:07,031
better than N log N so we might as well
call it a day and move on to some other

91
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:12,371
problem. and that's an example of
reduction for proving lower bounds to help

92
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:14,940
us guide our algorithm design efforts.
