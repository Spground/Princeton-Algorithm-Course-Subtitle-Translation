1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,850
Before we can get to the algorithm, we
have to consider another abstract concept

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,469
in the NFA and take a look at the NFA's
now. first of all, there's a duality, a

3
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:21,760
well-known duality between regular
expressions and DFAs. DFA is a discrete,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,757
finite automaton. that's an abstract
machine from, theoretical computer

5
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:32,411
science. which is a very simple idea. It's
a state machine for recognizing whether a

6
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:37,342
given string is in a given set. And, if
you're not familiar with those, they are

7
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:43,587
very easy to understand and we'll, look at
some examples. in a little summary from

8
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:48,715
basic theoretical computer science,
there's a very important theorem called

9
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:54,847
Kleene's theorem that, was, developed
actually here at Princeton in the 30's and

10
00:00:54,847 --> 00:01:00,032
it says that, for any discrete finite
state automaton, there exists a regular

11
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:05,695
expression that describes the same set of
strings. And equivalently, for any regular

12
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:11,494
expression, there's a DFA that recognizes
the same set of strings. and this is just,

13
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:16,501
an example. and if you have seen this,
this sort, this sort of thing will be

14
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,652
familiar and if we have, if you haven't
you know, and you will understand better

15
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:27,283
as we get into it. So, a discreet finite
state machine is a machine that has states

16
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:32,914
that are labeled and it has transitions
from state to state that are labeled with

17
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:38,133
characters. And, the way that it works is,
if it's in a state and it reads like for

18
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:43,489
every state is well defined is the next
character is zero or one it's another

19
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:48,260
state to go to. So for example at state
zero if you see a zero you stay in state

20
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,691
zero, if you see a one you go to state
one. In state one if you see a zero you

21
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:57,294
stay in state one, if you see a one you go
to state two, and so forth. So at every

22
00:01:57,294 --> 00:02:02,880
state. read a character and go to the well
defined next state. That's a discreet a

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,370
deterministic final state automaton. and
so, that's the machine you start it up on

24
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,814
a string, and it reads all of the
characters in the string. and then, if it,

25
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:21,442
ends up in a state that's so called
terminal state, and started on the start

26
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:25,031
state the terminal state is just in
dicated by this X that are on this

27
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:31,720
example. It ends up in the right state you
say that it recognizes a set of strings.

28
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:38,327
and so that's a way to determine if a
given string is in a specified set. The

29
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:45,430
machine specifies the set. In an RE the,
we specify the set by writing characters

30
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,459
and stars and meta-characters in
parenthesis and this regular expression

31
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,226
recognizes these same set of strings.
Describes these set of same, same set of

32
00:02:56,226 --> 00:03:01,494
strings that's recognized by this DFA.
Hank Leany's theorem showed that it's

33
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:08,242
always possible, to, construct such a
machine. So that gives a, a basic plan for

34
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:14,580
developing a pattern matching
implementation. and this is developed by

35
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,460
Ken Thompson at Bell labs, one of the
developers of UNIX, and, and this facility

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,990
was an important part of early UNIX and
developed this idea based on the

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,750
well-known theorem from theoretical
computer science. is let's try to build a

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,573
machine, the same way as we did for
Knuth-Morris-Pratt, where we have no

39
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:42,076
backup in the text input string. so we
just got a finite state machine. With

40
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:47,647
Knuth-Morris-Pratt we built a, a machine
for recognizing the one string how about

41
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:53,718
building one for multiple strings and that
would give us a linear time guarantee. so

42
00:03:53,718 --> 00:04:01,963
the unruling extractions is determine if
it's FSA or DFA and the basic plan is to

43
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:09,976
just go ahead and take your pattern. It
describes a set of strings and use that to

44
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:15,439
build a DFA and then simulate the DFA with
the Texas input, the same way we did for

45
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,943
Knuth-Morris-Pratt And if it accepts, we
say we have a match. If it rejects, we

46
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:28,320
don't have a match. this is a, a fine plan
but it's got a flaw. the bad news is that

47
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,430
The plan is infeasible because the number
of states in the DFA might be exponential

48
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:42,326
in the length of the RE. So, for it's got
too many states Kleene's, the proof of

49
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:48,205
Kleene's theorem, standard proof of
Kleene's theorem , involves the

50
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:53,921
exponential number of states. and it's not
that difficult to prove if you're

51
00:04:53,921 --> 00:05:00,311
interested be sure to look it up. But from
a practical, standpoint, too many states,

52
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:06,214
you can't use that as a basis for
algorithm. But there's an easy revision.

53
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:11,944
And again, this gets back. It will, it
will give us a quadratic time guarantee,

54
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:17,750
and actually, in, in real life, it's
usually linear, and all we do is change

55
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,091
the abstraction to use a non-deterministic
finite state machine, an NFA, rather than

56
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:31,027
a DFA. so, in the same basic plan, we're
going to build an NFA. It's a, it's a

57
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:39,378
different kind of machine, but actually,
it's also the case that, that, oh yeah.

58
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:45,512
For any regular expression we can build on
NFA so and in vice versa cleaning stand to

59
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:50,172
this and so we're going to simulate with
the NFA with the text as input. And so,

60
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:54,359
what do we, what do we mean by
non-determined as a finite state machine?

61
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:59,651
That's what we have to talk about next.
and we'll just do it with this example

62
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:06,217
that we used throughout this lecture. So,
It's very similar to the DFA that we have

63
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:12,201
before, now we're going to put the
characters in the states and actually, the

64
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:18,684
kind of NFA that we're going to build,
we're going to have one state for every

65
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:26,145
character in a regular expression. So this
is an NFA, corres-, corresponding to this

66
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:33,225
regular expression. just, to, We, we
always enclose the regular expressions in

67
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:40,136
parentheses. just to, make everything
work. and then, Got this regular

68
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:47,300
expression here. A star B or ACD. then,
we're going show how to build, this NFA.

69
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:52,452
and then, simulate it, to recognize the
regular expression. And, how is it

70
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:56,960
different than a DFA So, there's a
character in every state, and if the

71
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,726
character's a text character, it's the
same as before. We read that text

72
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:07,101
character and moved to the next state. But
it's a more general kind of machine,

73
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:12,936
because states also have what's called
epsilon transition. And with an epsilon

74
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:18,546
transition the machine is allowed to
change the state without scanning any

75
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:25,118
text. So, at the beginning the machine go
from zero to one, to two, back to one, I'm

76
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:31,398
sorry, two to three, back to two or it go
from zero to one over to six there's lots

77
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:38,004
of places the machine could go, without
scanning any text character. but we do

78
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:44,773
have the black matc h transitions that
scan text characters and so those are the

79
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:50,769
rules the machine operates by. And, the,
final rule is when does it accept, when

80
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,993
does it decide a strings in the pattern.
It accepts if there's any sequence of

81
00:07:55,993 --> 00:08:01,150
transitions that scans all the text
characters and ends in the accept case.

82
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:06,411
it's a way of specifying an infinite set
of strings. but it's got this

83
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:11,672
non-determinism. It's not always
determined what the machine, will do next.

84
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:16,934
It's a little bit of a mind blowing
concept in theoretical computer science.

85
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:22,403
But this particular example actually shows
how such, such a concept can be made

86
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:27,851
concrete and actually give us a widely
useful algorithm. One way to think of a

87
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:33,492
non-deterministic machine is a machine
that has super powers and can guess the

88
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:39,302
proper sequence of state transitions to
get to the end. Get to the accept state.

89
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:45,501
another way to think about is the
sequences if you provide us particular

90
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:51,777
sequences that's a proof that the machine
accepts the text. and so this is a real

91
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:58,368
machine. We don't have a real machines
that can guess the right answer but it's a

92
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:04,330
completely well specified abstract
machine, and we can write a program to

93
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,580
stimulate it's operation, and that's what
we are going to do. So let's just make

94
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,318
sure that everyone's got the concept down.
So, say we have the question is 4A is

95
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:24,142
followed by BD, is that accepted by this
NFA down here? and the answer is yes

96
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:30,795
because there is a sequence of legal
transitions that ends up in state eleven.

97
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:37,362
So in this case, we'll take an epsilon
transition from zero to one to two and

98
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:43,975
then we'll... We've got 4A's so we'll chew
up four A's, one, tw-, I'm sorry. One, and

99
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:49,605
then go back. Two, and then go back.
Three, and then go back. Four, and then

100
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:56,266
we'll be in state three. And then at that
point, we'll decide to take this epsilon

101
00:09:56,266 --> 00:10:02,372
transition. We'll assume your machine
decides to take this one. then it

102
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:10,690
recognizes the B and moves to state five.
And then, at state five, it no place to go

103
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,838
but to state eight. and then, takes the
epsilon transition to the state nine. It

104
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:22,689
recognizes the D that takes it out to ten
and eleven. So, there is a sequence of

105
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:28,910
state transitions that get to a eleven and
recognizes all the characters and the

106
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,065
strings, so therefore it's matched. what
about So the, It's true that there is

107
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:40,987
sequences that the machine might guess and
go to the wrong state or stall, it doesn't

108
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:45,571
matter as long as there's some sequence
and we are going to assume that the

109
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,156
machine always guesses the right one. So
for example, if the machine just

110
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:54,996
recognizes three A's, one, two, three, and
then went to state four, it would get

111
00:10:54,996 --> 00:11:00,281
stuck because there's no way for it to get
out of state four because state four is

112
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:05,131
looking for a B, and it's sitting on an A,
and so forth. So, there's definitely,

113
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,759
things that the machine could do that
would be wrong, but we don't care, as long

114
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,650
as there's some way for it to get through.
and then, what about if it's a string

115
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:22,691
that's not in a language recognized by the
state. the machine, well, so we have to

116
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:28,996
argue about all possible sequences and,
prove that, no sequence of legal

117
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:35,955
transition, is transitions ends in state
eleven. and that, seems to be, a fairly

118
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:42,958
complicated sort of argument. So in this
case the machine could recognize a bunch

119
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:50,061
of A's, and then go to state four. But
again, there's no B, so there's no way

120
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:56,446
it's going to get out of state four. and,
so you can make a general argument like

121
00:11:56,685 --> 00:12:02,758
looking at the machine that's any string
that it recognizes, it has to end in D and

122
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:08,734
this one doesn't end in D. that's a, much
more complicated thing, than we're talking

123
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:14,054
about, is to try to come up with, a,
simple machine that will decide whether or

124
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:20,059
not a string, is in the, language that it
specifies. so the question, so question

125
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,002
that we have is, we have this non
deterministic machine, how are we going to

126
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:31,125
decide whether a given string is in the
language that it recognizes. So for

127
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:36,931
deterministic machines, like we used for
Knuth-Morris-Pratt it's very easy, because

128
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:42,595
at every time, there's only one possible
transition. But for non-deterministic, if

129
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,897
you're, in some states, there's, multiple
ways to go, and you have to, figure out

130
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:54,491
the right transition. But actually, the
situation isn't so bad. and what we can do

131
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:59,730
is, to simulate the NFA, is just to make
sure that we consider all possible,

132
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:05,326
transition sequences. And that's what our
algorithm for a regular expression pattern

133
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,460
matching is going to be based on. that's
what we will look at next.
