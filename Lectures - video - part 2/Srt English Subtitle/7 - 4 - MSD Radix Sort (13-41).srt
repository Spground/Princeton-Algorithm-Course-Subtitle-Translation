1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,130
we can also get strings sorted by moving
from left to right.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,516
That's called MSD string sorter.
Most-significant-digit-first string sort.

3
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:19,346
And this is going to kind of, kind of
related to what we did with quick sort,

4
00:00:19,346 --> 00:00:23,109
and maybe viewed as a generalization of
quick sort.

5
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:30,046
So the idea is that we start with the
first character, to use key index counting

6
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:36,761
on the first character of the array and
that will partition it into the strings

7
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:39,270
that start with each character.
So.

8
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:44,592
If we use the first character, the
left-most character in a string as, as the

9
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:50,251
first character in this case, then we get
all the strings that start with A followed

10
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,619
by all the strings that start with B and
so forth.

11
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,594
And then recursively use the same method
for each subfile.

12
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:02,310
Essentially, we have a subarray for, each
of the characters.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,306
And, that cumulate that we built with key
index counting gives us the subarrays and

14
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:12,820
actually completely delineates the
subarrays that we need to sort.

15
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:19,233
Remember we had built up this array that
said that there's six keys less than d and

16
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:24,577
eight keys less than e and so forth.
So that tells us exactly precisely the

17
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:29,707
boundaries of the subarray that contain
the keys to start with d,

18
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:36,121
And then we can just use the same method
recursively to sort each of the subarrays

19
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,430
one for each character.
Mm.

20
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:44,549
Now, this is a little bit complicated
trace,

21
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:53,166
But if you look at it more carefully after
the lecture you'll see that it's pretty

22
00:01:53,166 --> 00:02:01,014
simple, setup for what we need to do.
So, here's our input and we sort on the

23
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:05,017
first character.
If we sort on the first character,

24
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,243
In this example, we have lots of s's.
So the subfile for the s's, it's already

25
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:14,767
sorted on the first character.
This d is the digit that we're currently

26
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:19,483
working on. So then, we sort that on,
it's, the rest of it on its first

27
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:22,733
character.
So it's the second character and all the

28
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:27,194
words that start with s.
And then there's a lot of them that start

29
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:30,253
with e,
So we move on to the third character for

30
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,375
those,
And then there's some that start with a

31
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,160
and so forth.
So, recursively,

32
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:45,623
Every time that we move on one character,
we have to keep going until one thing we

33
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:51,701
have to do, is if there's two keys that
are equal, we have to examine every

34
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:56,464
character in the key.
We never find out that the two keys are

35
00:02:56,464 --> 00:03:01,392
equal until the end.
And if we reach the end of a string, we

36
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:05,744
can just assume that goes before any
character value.

37
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:12,150
And with those two things, then you, you
can trace through the recursion to see how

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,693
MSD string sort of works.
So and again, in this case, it sorts by

39
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:21,307
the first character, A and B have only
size once, so you don't have to do

40
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:24,640
anything.
So then most of this slide is showing what

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,024
happens in the keys that start with S, and
then at the end, there's the two keys that

42
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:35,215
start with T, and they have both h's and
both e's, we have to go through the whole

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,909
thing.
So that's an example of MSD string sort.

44
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:45,527
Now, if strings are variable length like
they were in that example, we just treat

45
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:52,475
them as if they had an extra character at
the end that's smaller than any character.

46
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:59,259
So they'll appear before they're supposed
to appear alphabetically, before strings

47
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,809
that have the same starting characters
that are longer.

48
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:09,103
And you can do that by overloading, you
know, implementing charAt to just return

49
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:14,822
minus one, if, if we're past the character
that we're looking at.

50
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,760
So, that's the easy part of the
implementation.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,267
One thing to point out, the in the C
programming language, the representation

52
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:32,373
of strings puts an extra character that's
zero at the end and those string has the

53
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:37,510
zero character.
So, actually not to do anything at all.

54
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:46,160
But when that change the code for MSD
string sort is also really an extremely

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,442
simple modification or extension to key
index counting.

56
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:58,358
So we've got our sort and it takes its
input array and then, output buffer,

57
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:06,233
And then we have to take the deliminators
of the subfile we're going to sort, low

58
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:11,612
and high just like we've done for other
recursive sorts.

59
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:22,510
We go ahead and we do the key index
counting, again, to take care of, we have

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,879
to take care of the fact that we have an
extra character that kind of the end of

61
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,717
string character.
And also, pull out the d character of our

62
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:38,615
string just like we did for LSD sort.
And we just go through the whole thing and

63
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:44,050
sort according to the given character.
And then, what we do next is just do a

64
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,617
recursive call for every entry in the
counter array where we, we just sort the

65
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:55,472
part of the array from count of r to lo
plus count of r or lo plus count of r plus

66
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:59,575
one.
Really just one line of curve for each

67
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:03,442
subarray.
And then we move to the right one

68
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:07,703
character.
So, again, this is very little code to get

69
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:13,780
a very useful and powerful sorting method,
That's MSD string sorting.

70
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:18,258
One thing to notice is that, with the,
extra output buffer,

71
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,584
We can use that even with the recursive
calls,

72
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:25,859
But not the counter array,
We have to keep the counter array around.

73
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:30,338
So it's part, it's gotta be local to the
recursive procedure,

74
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:36,174
Cuz when we call for the next character,
we're going to need, a new counter array

75
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:42,078
for that character but have to save the
old one to do the next subarray for, the

76
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:45,875
calling, method.
Well that turns out to be important

77
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,695
because there's a potential for big
problems with MSD sort when we start

78
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:55,258
looking at the analysis.
And the thing to notice is that if you

79
00:06:55,258 --> 00:07:00,648
have a tiny array, say an array of size
two, it doesn't matter how small your

80
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:06,251
array is, you need to have a counter array
for each potential character in the

81
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:10,100
alphabet.
So for ASCII, just to, to initialize the

82
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,788
counter and to set it to zero, just create
it, it's going to be a hundred times

83
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:23,921
slower, then just sorting the thing or
just copying it back, even if you're using

84
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:30,877
Unicode, it's 32,000 times slower. And
what's worse is it's a recursive program,

85
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:34,890
so there's going to be lots of small
subarrays.

86
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:40,250
Sorry.
This feature or characteristic of MSD

87
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:48,828
string sort actually [INAUDIBLE], we're
having a lot of applications that were

88
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:56,119
using it when people switched from ASCII
to Unicode a while back.

89
00:07:56,441 --> 00:08:02,010
All of a sudden programs that were really
efficient sorts,

90
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:07,330
All of a sudden, became hundreds of times
slower, with the switch to Unicode,

91
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:13,175
Because these big arrays in the recursive,
these big arrays in the recursive

92
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,460
procedure.
It was a, a serious performance problem,

93
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,240
So we definitely have to watch out for
that, with, MSD string sort.

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,444
Now there is a good solution to avoid this
danger and it's the same solution we've

95
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:32,256
used before.
If you've got a small subarray and the

96
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:36,367
sort is going to be slower just cut off
the insertion sort.

97
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:42,226
The other thing you can do is and save
some more time, is to just have insertion

98
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:46,321
sort start at the character that we're
currently working on.

99
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:52,598
Cuz we know things are, equal, to the left
and we're just looking for the right.

100
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:58,467
And, that's easy to implement just by
changing the implementation of the compare

101
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:02,425
function, to take into account which
character we're at.

102
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,929
Notice it's quicker,
And, and it happens to be quicker in Java

103
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:12,280
to just pull out the substrings and use
compare to, than to go in and get the

104
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,160
charAt that's just a feature of the
implementation.

105
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:22,158
So switching to, cutting off the insertion
sort for small subarrays is definitely a

106
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:27,964
good idea for MSD string sort.
And so, what about the performance of this

107
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,985
method?
Well the key characteristic of, of MSD

108
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:37,568
string sorting, it examines just the
characters that it needs to examine in

109
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:42,631
order to get the C key sorted.
So, that means that its performance is

110
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:48,666
going to be really dependent on the data.
Now, in the, worst case for the algorithm,

111
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,631
it has to examine all the data, in this
case all the characters in all the

112
00:09:54,631 --> 00:10:00,521
strings, and that's, for example, when
they're all equal, it's going to look at

113
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:05,219
all the characters.
If you have some duplicate keys, it might

114
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:11,258
have to examine all the characters in
those duplicate keys, but there's plenty

115
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:16,180
of other strings that it doesn't examine
all the characters. so,

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,682
That, depending on, and end of the keys
are random in some way, if they, or

117
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:27,332
they're approximated by random keys.
Then it's not going to examine very many

118
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:32,248
characters at all,
Actually and this is a typical case, say,

119
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:38,558
for account numbers or some situation
library call numbers or some situation

120
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,980
like that,
In a case like that.

121
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,531
Msd string sort will examine only a small
fraction of the data,

122
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:51,527
A small constant fraction of the data,
And it's always going to be sublinear.

123
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:57,739
Now, it's also possible that sorts that do
comparisons can be sublinear, but MSD

124
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:02,652
string sort is, you, you know, good and
that it really only examines the

125
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:07,420
characters that need to be examined in
order to get the sort done.

126
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,653
So this gives us another line on, on the
table,

127
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:19,062
And the key here is that if the data is
approximated by random log base r of N is

128
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:24,680
going to be pretty well approximated by a
constant in the real world.

129
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:31,596
So this is going to be a fast method.
The one danger is that, you have to worry

130
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:38,674
out [inaudible], worry about using too
much extra space, with those big counter

131
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:42,173
arrays.
But that's a important and useful,

132
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:48,666
practical sorting method.
So now let's look at, MSD string sort

133
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:55,354
versus Quicksort for strings.
There, it, they are similar in many ways.

134
00:11:55,354 --> 00:12:00,957
They're both recursive methods that,
partition a file up.

135
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:08,022
So one of the problems with MSD string
sort is that, It tends to, when it's doing

136
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:13,229
the counting, it's kind of making random
accesses to memory when it, particularly

137
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:18,891
when it's distributing the keys out.
So on modern systems that have caches not

138
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:24,554
everything is in the fastest memory at, at
the same time and programs that move from

139
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:29,760
one piece of data to another right next
are, are going to be much more efficient.

140
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,950
And quicksorts like that, an MSD quicksort
is not.

141
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,382
Another disadvantage of MSD string sort is
that there's actually quite a few

142
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:43,697
instructions in, in our loop.
With the indexing and accounting.

143
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:47,878
And the plus and [inaudible] in the
accumulating and so forth,

144
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:54,906
Whereas Quicksort remember is fast,
because it has only a few instructions in

145
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:59,568
the inner loop.
And amnesty strings are used as extra

146
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:03,221
space,
Whereas quick sort, there's two things,

147
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:08,501
one is, it's not linear in these
applications, where MSD string sort is,

148
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:14,233
and kind of the reason that it's not
linear, is that if you've got keys that

149
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:20,266
have a lot of the same characters at the
beginning, when it's doing the compares,

150
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,490
it has to rescan or recompare, lots of
those characters.

151
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,920
So, what were going to look at next, is
try to get this, achieve this goal, of
