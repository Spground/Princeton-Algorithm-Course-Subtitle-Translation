1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,635
Now we will look a Kruskal's algorithm for
computing the MST this is an old algorithm

2
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:17,941
that dates back over 50 years but it is an
effective way to solve the problem.

3
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,431
The idea is very simple.
We are going to take the edges and we are

4
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:27,194
going to sort them by weight.
And we are going to consider ''em in order

5
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:31,747
of ascending weight.
And the algorithm is simply add the next

6
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,912
edge to the tree.
Unless that edge would create a cycle.

7
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:40,030
If it, if the edge creates cycle, ignore
it and go on to the next one.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,791
Let's look at a demo of Kruskal's
algorithm.

9
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,635
Okay.
So we have the edges sorted by weight and

10
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:52,051
we're going to take them in ascending
order of weight.

11
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:58,593
The smallest edge is in the MST.
And so we add that to the tree it doesn't

12
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:02,919
create a cycle.
Next smallest edge is two, three.

13
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:07,997
That doesn't create a cycle.
Next one is one, seven that's fine.

14
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,848
Next one is zero, two.
Next one, five, seven.

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,776
Now when we get to one, three that one
creates a cycle and the algorithm says,

16
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:21,878
creates a cycle just ignore it.
Next one is one, five that one also

17
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,724
creates a cycle. one, five, seven.
Again, just ignore it.

18
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:31,788
Two, seven creates a cycle not in the MST.
Four, five that, the next smallest edge

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,560
does not create a cycle so we add it to
the MST.

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,759
One, two creates a cycle.
Four, seven creates a cycle.

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,202
Zero, four creates a cycle.
And finally we get to six, two which does

22
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:48,780
not create a cycle, so we add that to the
tree.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,622
At this point we have an MST we could
check that we have V - one edges and stop

24
00:01:54,622 --> 00:02:00,399
or we can just keep going and see that the
other edges in the graph create a cycle.

25
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,788
And when we're done considering all the
edges then we have computed the minimum

26
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:08,774
spanning tree.
That's with Kruskal's Algorithm.

27
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:13,902
Consider the edges in descending order of
weight, add the next edge to T, unless

28
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:18,577
doing so would create a cycle.
Now let's look at what Kruskal's algorithm

29
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:23,410
does on a very large graph.
You get a good feeling for what it's

30
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,037
doing.
It's taking the small edges and they

31
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:34,123
coalless together in little clusters and
eventually the edges get longer and longer

32
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:41,798
and they connect together the clusters.
Initially it is broken up into the very

33
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:49,137
small edges and after a while if you look
at the larger clusters eventually an edge

34
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:56,141
will come that will connect them together.
It's not going to be so easy to see how

35
00:02:56,141 --> 00:03:01,420
the algorithm ends.
Though there's some, long edge there.

36
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:07,910
That's the longest edge in the MST that'll
finally connect the graph.

37
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:15,454
This simulation really gives a good
feeling for Kruskal's algorithm.

38
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:22,227
In fact when we first had personal
computers I was fortunate to be in Xerox

39
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:25,812
Park.
And I remember very well in the late 70s,

40
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:31,857
This was one of the first algorithms that
I wanted to see visualized on a personal

41
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:35,653
computer.
And I, I wrote a program at that time that

42
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:41,768
produced pretty much this image it's a
very interesting way to look at MST

43
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:46,478
algorithms.
Alright, so it's easy to implement we have

44
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:52,104
to prove that it computes the MST of
course I and we've done a lot of work

45
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,894
setting that up.
And.

46
00:03:54,586 --> 00:04:01,240
We do so just by proving that its a
special case of the greedy MST algorithm.

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,920
So what does that mean?
Well.

48
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:11,356
It, suppose that crosco's algorithm.
Colors a given edge black.

49
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:16,140
So say it's VW.
So we'll define a cut.

50
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:21,491
That, is the set of vertices that are
connected to V.

51
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:29,886
So it might be just a V, but if theres any
black edges connecting V to other vertices

52
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:37,215
we put all of those in the cut.
So for that cut there's no black crossing

53
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:40,773
edge.
Cuz it's a, it's a component.

54
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:48,731
And the other thing is that there's no
crossing edge with lower weight than VW.

55
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:52,830
And why is that?
Well we haven't examined any of those

56
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,579
edges yet, and they're all longer because
we are considering the edges in increasing

57
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:03,438
order of their weight.
So this new edge that connects V somewhere

58
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:10,077
else is a crossing edge of minimal weight.
And so therefore the algorithm always

59
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:15,894
finds a cut and colors a crossing edge of
minimal weight for that cut black.

60
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,180
And it's an instance of the Greedy
Algorithm.

61
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:28,152
Now we still have a bit away from having
an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.

62
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:35,725
So the question is, how do we know whether
adding a new edge to the tree will cause a

63
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,872
cycle?
So, you might think about how difficult

64
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,439
that is.
I've, I've got a tree, that's represented

65
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,964
as the set of edges or however.
And I have a new edge, and I want to know

66
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:52,790
whether it creates a cycle or not.
How, how difficult is that going to be?

67
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:59,664
Well, it turns out way back in the first
lecture of algorithms part one we had a

68
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:03,526
way.
What one thing we could do is just run DFS

69
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:09,165
to check if we can get to W from V.
That'd take time proportional to V.

70
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:16,040
But the union find data structure that we
did in the first lecture absolutely does

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,902
the job.
It's just testing whether this edge

72
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:26,792
connects anybody in, in the equivalence
class corresponding to V with anybody in

73
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:32,190
the equivalence class corresponding to Y,
for to W and if it did, it creates a

74
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,390
cycle.
So union find is exactly what we need.

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,965
So we're going to what we're going to do
is maintain a set for each of the

76
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:49,586
connected components in the spanning tree,
that we built up so far and so if the new

77
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:55,691
edge connects vertices that are in the
same set, then that means it would create

78
00:06:55,691 --> 00:07:00,226
a cycle.
And otherwise we're going to be adding the

79
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:04,780
edge to the tree.
So then we just do the union operation and

80
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,803
merge the set containing V with the set
containing W.

81
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:14,799
Those are the two things that we need to
do and those are the two things that union

82
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:19,320
find does for us.
So this leads to a very compact

83
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,556
implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm.
Now to consider the edges in order, we'll

84
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:29,187
use a, a priority queue, a modern data
structure.

85
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:35,597
So let's take a look the, the every line
of this implementation of Kruskal's

86
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:39,537
algorithm.
We are going to have a queue of edges.

87
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:43,012
That's how we are going to represent the
MST.

88
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:47,570
It could be a stack or bag, but, but we'll
use a queue.

89
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:52,259
And then, the, Cruskill MST algorithm
takes a graph.

90
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:56,393
And it's going to compute the MST in this
MST.

91
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,798
And to do that, it's going to use a
priority queue, a min priority queue.

92
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:05,455
A minimum oriented priority queue of
edges.

93
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:10,065
So we'll build that minimum, priority
queue.

94
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:15,948
Now edges are comparable.
We had a compare to a method so our, our,

95
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,320
generic priority queue code is going to
work fine.

96
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:26,553
And so, what we'll do is we'll put all the
edges in the graph into the priority

97
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:30,053
queue.
So that's building a priority queue.

98
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,184
Containing all the edges in the graph.
Alternatively, we could put the edges in

99
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:40,580
an array and sort the array, but priority
queues.

100
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:48,367
A more elegant way to express this, and is
a way to look at more efficient algorithms

101
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:52,175
as well.
Okay, so that's priority queue, so that's

102
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:57,254
the first data structure from part one
that we're going to make use of.

103
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:01,332
And then the second one is the union find
data structure.

104
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:08,056
So we're going to build a union find data
structure with for vertices because the

105
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:12,634
spanning force divides the vertices into
equivalence classes.

106
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:18,467
So then we go into the main loop.
And the main loop stops in two conditions.

107
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:23,390
We run out of edges is one, where we'd
have a minimum spinning force.

108
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:28,530
Or the other condition is we get to V -
one edges in the MST.

109
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:34,944
So as long as neither one of those is
true, then we've got an edge in the

110
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:39,410
priority queue, and we want to take the
smallest one.

111
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:44,105
We want to get its vertices V and W either
and other.

112
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:51,030
And then we want to check using the union
find algorithm if they're connected.

113
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:57,979
If they're connected we don't want to do
anything, if they're not connected then we

114
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:01,883
want to merge them, and put that edge onto
the MST.

115
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:06,204
Thats it.
And then when the that's the full

116
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:13,365
implementation and then we have the edges
method for the client to return the MST.

117
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:18,245
It's quite a compact implementation of a
classic algorithm.

118
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:24,698
Using the basic data structures that we
built up in algorithm part one data

119
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:27,846
structures and algorithms of priority
queue.

120
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:34,930
And union find gives a, a, really fine
implementation of this MST algorithm.

121
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,777
So what about the running time of this
algorithm?

122
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:45,065
Well it's not hard to see that it's going
to compute the MST in time proportional to

123
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:50,022
e log e.
It's linearithmic in the number of edges.

124
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:53,500
Which means that we can use it for huge
graphs.

125
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:59,697
So this is just, this table is just a
proof that, summarizes the costs.

126
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:04,406
We're going to first build the priority
queue.

127
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:11,182
And, we can do that in linear time using
bottom-up, construction method.

128
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,741
We have to, every edge comes off the
priority Q.

129
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:20,695
So there's E of them, and it takes log E
per operation.

130
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:28,310
Snd then union operations, every vertex is
involved in one, and connected operations,

131
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,732
every edge is involved in one.
So the total time is dominated by the E

132
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:42,633
log E for the priority queue operations.
One thing to note is that, if the edges

133
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:48,487
come in, in sorted order, for some reason,
it's almost linear.

134
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:56,413
The order of growth is E log star of E.
And, actually we don't have to always,

135
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:01,636
sort'em.
We can, in real life situations, we can

136
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:09,106
stop when we get the V-1 edges in the MST.
When we have those v - one edges we can

137
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:15,418
stop and usually that's for practical
situations that's way before we see all

138
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:19,910
the edges in the graph.
So that's Kruskal's algorithm for

139
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,380
computing the MST.
