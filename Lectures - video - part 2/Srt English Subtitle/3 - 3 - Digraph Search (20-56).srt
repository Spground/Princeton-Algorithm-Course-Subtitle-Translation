1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,870
Okay. First, we're gonna look at the
search algorithm for, digraphs and this is

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:17,036
the finding paths, what are all the
vertices that we can get to from a given

3
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:23,861
vertex along a directed path. and again,
this is, little more complex for a digraph

4
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:30,115
it would seem, than for a graph. so in
this case, those are the, that's the set

5
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:36,369
of vertices that you can get to, from the
given vertex x, s. Notice that, this set

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:42,771
is characterized by every edge crossing
the boundary, it goes in. if there were an

7
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:49,703
edge that went out, that would give,
another member of the set.. well actually,

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:57,441
looks more complicated to a human, but to
the computer, it looks exactly, precisely

9
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:03,721
the same. in fact. the method that we
looked at for undirected graphs is

10
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:10,435
actually a digraph processing algorithm.
it treats, every connection between two

11
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:17,069
vertices as two directed edges, one in
each direction. So, DFS, that we looked at

12
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,770
last time is actually a digraph algorithm.
And we used precisely the same code. So to

13
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:30,348
visit a vertex V, we mark the vertex as
visited, and recursively visit all

14
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:39,180
unmarked vertices W, that you can get to
from V. let's look at the demo, just to, .

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,592
Reinforce that. So, here's a sample
digraph with the edges over at the right.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,837
let's look at that first search on that
digraph. so, we're going to look at the

17
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:56,318
vertices that we can get to from vertex
zero in this digraph. Again, we have two

18
00:01:56,318 --> 00:02:02,147
vertex index to raise. one called marked,
which says whether we can get there from

19
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:07,490
V, and the other called edge two, which
gives us the vertex that took us there.

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,743
with that we can recover the paths from
vertex zero to each vertex that can be

21
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:20,071
reached from vertex zero. So we start off
by visiting vertex zero and now check the

22
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:26,104
edges that are adjacent to it with
directed edges going out. so there's five

23
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:32,652
and then there's gonna be one. but five is
unmarked so we have to re-cursedly visit

24
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:40,967
five. So we mark five, and we say we got
there from zero. so the path from, to five

25
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:48,149
is zero to five. and so now we're gonna
recursively visit all the unmarked

26
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:53,679
vertices pointed to from five .
In this case it's just four. My four is

27
00:02:53,679 --> 00:03:00,169
unmarked so we're gonna recursively visit
four and say we got there from five. and

28
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:06,142
now recursively we have to check all the
unmarked vertices pointing from four.

29
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:12,557
there's three. and two, first we do three
and that's unmarked. so we gotta visit

30
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:18,702
three. and say that we got there from
four. and now to visit three. We've looked

31
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:24,199
at all the vertices pointing from three.
we can check five. We've already been to

32
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,894
five that's marked so we don't have to do
anything. and then we check two. two is

33
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:35,324
unmarked so we continue with the depth
first search and visit two. so now to

34
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:41,218
visit we mark two, and say we've got there
from three. and now we check the vertices

35
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:46,516
that we can get two from two. In this case
it's zero, which we've already been to.

36
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:52,579
And three, which we've already been to.
so. now we're done with vertex two. and we

37
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:58,477
can return and continue the search from
three well actually that was the last one

38
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:03,972
from three, so we're done with three as
well. so now we're at four. We still have

39
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:09,534
checked the edge from four to two. so now
we do that. And of course we've been to

40
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:14,908
two, so we don't have any further
processing. and we're done with four. the,

41
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:21,726
, four was the only edge we get to from
five. So we're going to be done with five

42
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:28,309
as well. and then, what about zero, well
we have to check one. 1's not visited, so

43
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:34,872
we visit one, mark it. and we turn and
then we're done with zero, and that gives,

44
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:41,264
the set of all vertices that are reachable
from zero, and not only that the edge to

45
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:46,713
array. Gives the information that we need
to reconstruct the path from any of those,

46
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:51,912
from zero to any of those vertices using
precisely the same method that we used

47
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:57,111
before. We get the four from five, we get
the five from zero, so zero, five, four is

48
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:03,080
the path to four. And we can do that for
any vertex in that cell. Okay. So what

49
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,580
about the code? the code is exactly the
same as for , undirected graphs. That's

50
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,753
the code for undirected graphs. that we
looked at last time to get the code for

51
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:23,164
digraphs, we just changed the name, its
the s ame code, otherwise. the recursive,

52
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:29,143
the constructor, builds the array of
marked vertices, and also builds edge too,

53
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:35,626
just to, avoid clutter, left that one off
this slide, and then it makes the call to

54
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:41,893
DFS. then the recursive DFS does the work.
It marks the vertex and for every adjacent

55
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:47,726
vertex. If its not marked, it does the
DFS. and then the client can ask whether

56
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:52,090
any ver-, any given vertex is reachable
from s after the constructor has done its

57
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,080
work. that's depth-first search in
directed graphs, actually, we already did

58
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,158
it. now here's just a couple of
applications where this kind of code is

59
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:10,115
used. one is, a so called program control
flow analysis. actually every program can

60
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:16,610
be viewed as a digraph. where, the
vertices are basic blocks of instructions

61
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,186
that are just executed one after the other
with no conditionals. and then edges

62
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:29,922
represent, a, jump. If there's an if
statement, vertex left, two edges going

63
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:37,299
out of it, or, or a loop, which involves a
conditional. So, , analyzing a program,

64
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,002
people write systems in analyse program,
to look at their structure by studying

65
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:48,797
their diagrams, for example. one thing
that happens often is there's unreachable

66
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:54,724
code. another, another thing you might
want to do is determine whether you can

67
00:06:54,724 --> 00:07:01,077
get to this exit or not, by doing this
digraph processing. so that's actually a

68
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:09,805
widely used technique in, in developing
software, software development. to try to

69
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:15,426
improve code by doing this kind of
digraph-processing. And ofcourse these

70
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:23,907
digraphs can be huge. another classic use
of depth for search in digraphs is garbage

71
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:32,664
collection that is used in systems like
Java where data structures or digraphs. we

72
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:41,035
build objects and then we create
references to other objects. and so the

73
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:49,443
data that any programs use is really set
as a digraph. So there's the idea of

74
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:57,537
roots, so your program has e-. Some. live
objects, that it can access through,

75
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,446
whatever state, it's in, but, a language
like Java, there's, automatic garbage

76
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:10,423
collection, which means the programmer,
when it's done with an object, maybe it

77
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:16,711
overwrites one of these pointers or
something. there's gonna be some, blocks,

78
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:23,387
that, are not directly accessible by the
program. and so, what's interesting is,

79
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:29,792
the set of reachable objects that, can be
indirectly access. By the program starting

80
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:35,898
and following a chain of pointers. so
those are the ones that can't be collected

81
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:41,539
or reclaimed by the system for reusing the
memory. But all the other ones, the gray

82
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,244
ones that can't be reached by the program
there's no reason to . Keep them live, you

83
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:54,876
may as well collect them and return them
for use, re-use. So there's a so-called

84
00:08:54,876 --> 00:09:01,521
marked and sweep out rhythm that actually
dates back to 1960, where. We run DFS to

85
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:07,434
mark all ritual objects. and then go
through and sweep through all possible

86
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:14,077
objects. And if it's object is unmarked
it's garbage so add it to the list of free

87
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:20,647
memory. and that's a classic method that's
still widely used. it uses an extra bit

88
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:26,779
per object'cause you have to have to have
that for the mark. But still, it's

89
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:33,821
effective and useful digraph solution. So
DFS with reachability that we've just

90
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:40,868
showed and path finding is similar. And
there's a couple of other simple digraph

91
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:48,002
problems that we'll consider. These are so
far examples. But it's also interesting

92
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:54,785
that DFS is the basis for solving digraph
problems that are not so simple or

93
00:09:54,785 --> 00:10:01,479
immediate to solve. And this was pointed
out 40 years ago by Bob Tarjan in a

94
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:07,339
seminal paper that showed that. First
search, can allow us to solve problems

95
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:13,668
that seem pretty complicated actually, in
linear time, and we're gonna look at an

96
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:20,735
example of that later on. so that's depth
for search. what about breadth for search.

97
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:28,148
Well in the same way that we saw for depth
for search every undirected graph is

98
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:34,674
actually a digraph that has edges in both
direction. So bfs is really a directed

99
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:41,603
graph algorithm and we can use exactly the
same code to find shortest paths from a

100
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:48,209
source to any given vertex. So we use a
que. We put the source on a que and mark

101
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:54,404
it as visited and. And as long as the
queue is non-empty, we remove the least

102
00:10:54,404 --> 00:11:00,947
recently added vertex and add to the que
ue and mark as visited all the unmarked

103
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:07,491
vertices that you can get to from that
vertex. And the same proof shows that BFS

104
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:14,035
computes shortest paths, the ones with the
fewest number of edges from S to each

105
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:20,087
other vertex in the digraph in time
proportional to in linear time. So you

106
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:29,219
want the GPS in your car, you BFS when
you're driving around lower Manhattan. So,

107
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,257
let's look at the demo again just to see,
the distinction between, breadth first

108
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:43,215
search, in digraphs and see how it works.
So this is a, a small graphing, a smaller

109
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:50,013
digraphic and with six vertices and eight
edges. we take a Q and we take a source

110
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:56,731
vertex and put on the Q to get started.
then, Q is not empty, so remove zero and

111
00:11:56,731 --> 00:12:03,350
we check all, all vertices that are
adjacent that we get to. So. we're gonna,

112
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:13,911
in zero was zero distance, from zero, so
first we will check two. and that one is

113
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:20,782
not marked, so we mark it and put it on
the queue. and then we'll check one. and

114
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:26,393
that one's not marked, so we mark it and
put it on the queue. then we're done with

115
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:33,616
zero. now queue's not empty so we pull the
least recently added off, that's two. and

116
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:39,935
now we're going to check the vertices, you
can get from two. I noticed both one and

117
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:45,410
two are distance one from zero. And now,
since we're going from two, everything

118
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,814
that we encounter will be distance two
from the source. So we find four, it's

119
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:56,290
distance two from the source, and we get
there from vertex two. Unmarked, so we

120
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:02,172
fill in those data structures and put it
on the queue. and then we're done with

121
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:08,006
two, so we go back to the queue, and 1's
on the queue. So we pull one off and it's

122
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:14,205
distance one from zero. Remember the first
showed that everything in the queue is one

123
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:19,894
of two distance, either k or k plus one.
In this case, we've got one at distance

124
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:25,584
one, four at distance two. So now we're
going to pull one off the queue. M- and

125
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:30,316
look at the edges you can get to, places
you can get to from one. Now we check two

126
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:35,931
but that's already marked so we ignore it.
and then we're done with one. Now four is

127
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:42,130
left on the Q so we pull it off and check
adjacent vertices. In this case three,

128
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,485
it's unmarked so we put it on the Q. Then
we're done with four. Then from three we

129
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:54,762
check five and that's unmarked and it's
one more distance from the source so we

130
00:13:54,762 --> 00:14:01,039
put it on the Q. And then finally. Oh we
check two which we already visited so we

131
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:07,333
don't have to, to do anything. And then
finally we pull five off the Q. check. Or

132
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:12,382
you get two from five and it's zero, which
is marked, so we're done. and so that's

133
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:18,279
breadth-first search whig, which gives us
this directed tree from the source. Which

134
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,816
gives the shortest path to all the
vertices that you can get to from that

135
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:30,410
source. you can use a version of this to
solve a more general problem known as the

136
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,590
multiple-source shortest paths problem. In
this problem you're given a digraph and a

137
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,480
set of source vertices, and you want to
find the shortest path from any vertix in

138
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,932
the set to each other vertix. So for
example, in this case if the set is one,

139
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:54,207
seven, and ten, what's the shortest path
to four? From one of those vertices. Well,

140
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:01,439
it turns out in this case to be seven, six
to four. Shortest path to five is seven,

141
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:07,542
six, zero, five. Shortest path to twelve
is ten to twelve. That's a more general

142
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:13,628
problem but it's actually easy to solve.
How do we implement this? We just use a

143
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:20,098
different constructor. We just use BFS but
initialize by, put all the source vertices

144
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:26,183
on the queue to get started. So that is
every vertex is, so you put those on the

145
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:32,499
queue and they're zero from the desired
source. And then any vertex you can get to

146
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:38,965
from any one of those is going to be. One
and so forth, so the results still gives

147
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:44,764
away. The edge to array will still give a
way to get from any vertex, the shortest

148
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:50,073
way to get from any vertex to each of the
sour-, source vertices. here's an

149
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:57,325
application of depth-first search. Let's
say you want to crawl the whole web, well,

150
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:04,328
all the web that you can access from some
starting web page, say like Princeton's

151
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:10,996
starting webpage. Again, the digraph
model, each vertex is a webpage, each edge

152
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:17,915
is a link on that webpage to some other
webpage. and so all we want to do is get

153
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:24,440
to all the other vertices on the web. And,
so solution is, well, we don't actually

154
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:31,504
build the digraph we just use an implicit
digraph, because for every web page we can

155
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:38,720
find the links to other web pages on it
and we'll just build those as we encounter

156
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,176
them. So we're gonna start with a source,
which is the root web page. We're gonna

157
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:51,701
have a queue of the sites that we still
need to explore. what we're going to do is

158
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:58,439
also have a set of discovered websites,
this corresponds to our marked array but

159
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:05,254
since we don't know how many vertices
there are on the web all we're going to do

160
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:11,757
is keep track of the ones that we've been
to. so this is, don't use the vertex

161
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:18,259
indexed array we don't even bother with
because we'll just use the vertex names

162
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:25,100
and do the look up as indicated we could
do. So all we do is In the, is but for a

163
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:31,680
search the same method is if the queue's
not empty. Take a website off of the cue.

164
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,605
And just add to the queue all the websites
to which it links. but all of those

165
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:41,653
websites, you check whether they're in the
set of the ones that you've seen already.

166
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:47,247
now, you might run out of space, for this
set before you get to the whole web. but

167
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:53,735
anyway, conceptually, this is a way that
you could go. one thing to think about is

168
00:17:54,056 --> 00:18:03,986
why not use DFS for this. well One reason
is you, you're gonna go far away in your

169
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:10,160
search for the web. Maybe, maybe that's
what you want, but the real problem, in

170
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,570
point of fact is there's some web pages
that would trap such a search by creating

171
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,744
new web pages and make links to'em the
first time that you visit'em. So, they,

172
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:29,466
trap searches like that by, cuz DFS would
always go to a new web page like that and

173
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:35,255
it'd keep creating new ones and you
wouldn't get very far. With breadt-first

174
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:41,670
search you're taking a wide search of the
pages that are close. and that's often

175
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:48,302
maybe what you want for such a search.
and, just to how simple the idea is, this

176
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:56,006
is complete code for a, it's kind of a
bare bones web crawler but it'll get to a

177
00:18:56,006 --> 00:19:03,971
lot of websites. so let's look at, do this
example because again it really indicates

178
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:10,983
the power of using appropriate
abstractions to implement the algorithms

179
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:18,476
that we're interested in. so this one
we're gonna use a cue. Queue of strings so

180
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:25,392
that's the websites that we have to still
yet to go to. and then a set of strings is

181
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:31,610
gonna be the ones that we've already been
to that's equivalent to the marked array.

182
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:39,569
we'll start with Princeton's website. add
it to the queue of places we have to go

183
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:46,450
and also mark it. Discovered that ad just
means mark it. so now, while the queue's

184
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:54,854
not empty. What we're going to do is read
the raw HTML from the next website in the

185
00:19:54,854 --> 00:20:02,430
queue. So this is code using our input
library that gets that job done. And then,

186
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:09,267
this is a little fooling around with
regular expressions. We'll talk about

187
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:16,381
algorithms like this later on, that
essentially tries to find all URLs within

188
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:23,408
the text of that website. And for all of
those URL's. And we'll. Look at workers

189
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:29,968
behind this code later on in this course.
For all those URL's it's gonna check. If

190
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:36,837
it's marked that's discovered doc contains
and if it's not marked it'll say it will

191
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:44,420
mark it and put it on the queue. a very s-
simple program with a very powerful effect

192
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,900
that illustrates breadth-first search.
