1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,637
Next we'll look at a proof that the
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is valid, known

2
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:13,965
as the max-flow min-cut theorem.
It also proves that the two problems are

3
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:18,589
equivalent.
We need a couple more definitions to, to

4
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:24,430
show, first we want to show the
relationship between a flow and a cut.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:32,092
So in this case we've got a cut where T is
on one side and all the other vertices are

6
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:37,673
on the same side as S.
And what we talk about is the flow across

7
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:41,971
the cut.
And that, what that is, is the sum of the

8
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:49,506
flow on it's edges that go from S to T,
minus the amount that goes the other way.

9
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:57,132
That's the flow across the cut.
So this, what's called the flow value

10
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:01,400
lemma is that, if you have a flow then for
any cut.

11
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:06,150
The net flow across the cut is the value
of the flow.

12
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:13,740
That's called the flow value lemma.
Doesn't matter what the cut is, this, this

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:22,004
is a max flow, a flow with value 25 and
every cut is going to have 25 flowing

14
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:26,712
across it.
So, this cut, this is a more complicated

15
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,708
cut where S and these three vertices are
colored.

16
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:40,551
So the flow of a, across that cut has to
take the all the edges that go from a gray

17
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:47,303
vertex to a white one.
So, there's ten plus ten, plus from a gray

18
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:55,370
vertex to a white one, five plus ten + 00.
Then, we have to subtract off the edges

19
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,204
that go from a white to a gray one.
So we add up all the ones that go from

20
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:06,070
gray to white.
Ten + ten + five + ten + zero + zero and

21
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,695
subtract off the two that go from a white
to a gray and, still, the net value across

22
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:14,610
the flow is the same, the value of the
flow.

23
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,864
That's the flow value lemma that gives a
particular relationship between flows and

24
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:26,200
cuts.
And that's not too difficult to prove by

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,139
induction on the size of one of the sets.
For example, if we do an induction on the

26
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:39,526
size of the set containing T, it's
certainly true when that set consists of

27
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:46,150
just T, because the value of the flow is
exactly equal to the edges coming into T.

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,602
And then to prove by induction, you can
move any vertex from A to B in local

29
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:57,399
elibriums, local equilibrium's going to
make sure that the flow value limma is

30
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,298
true.
And so that's, that's how it's proved.

31
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:05,681
And a corollary of that is that, that
outflow from S is equal to the inflow to

32
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,030
T, which is equal to the val, all equal to
the value of the flow.

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,550
And that's also easy to see in all of our
examples.

34
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:23,500
So to get started let's, let's look at
what's called weak duality.

35
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:32,590
If, F is any flow at all, in network.
If AB is any cut.

36
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,510
The value of the flow is going to be less
than or equal to the capacity of the cut.

37
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,337
So in this case value of flow is 27 and
the capacity of the cut is 30.

38
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:49,011
Value of the flow is always less than or
equal to the capacity of the cut.

39
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:56,295
And well the net flow across a cut has got
to be less than less than or equal to it's

40
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:02,812
capacity 'coz it's at least that and then
if there's any edges going the other way,

41
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:06,416
they get subtracted to compute the lugnut
flow.

42
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,940
So a weak duality, is that, that's an easy
thing to prove.

43
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,624
So what we want to prove are these two
theorems.

44
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:21,273
The max-flow min-cut theorem is really two
theorems combined called the augmenting

45
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:27,040
path theorem that says the flow's at
max-flow if and only if there's no

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,369
augmenting paths, and that the value of
the max-flow equals the capacity of the

47
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,229
min-cut.
In any network.

48
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,717
And the way we prove that is to prove that
the following three conditions are

49
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:44,443
equivalent.
Again this is a proof that's a little

50
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:49,118
intricate logically.
It's worthwhile for me to go through it,

51
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:54,944
but to really understand it you're going
to need to read it carefully and convince

52
00:04:54,944 --> 00:05:00,611
yourself that these three conditions work.
So here's the three conditions that we're

53
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:05,315
going to prove our equipment.
First one is, there is a cut, there's some

54
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,540
cut whose capacity equals the value of the
flow.

55
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:14,453
The second one is that f is a max flow.
So if there's a cut whose capacity equals

56
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:19,347
the flow then f is a max flow.
And if f is a max flow there's such a cut.

57
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:23,698
And then the third one is that there's no
augmenting path.

58
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,912
So we're going to prove those three
conditions are equivalent.

59
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,971
And we'll do it with a little logic
trickery.

60
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:34,030
So first we could prove that one implies
two.

61
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,886
If there exist a cut capacities equals the
value flow, then f is the max flow.

62
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:45,260
Alright, so suppose that we have such a
cut, capacity is equal the value of the

63
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,254
flow then any other flow by weak duality,
flow is going to be less than or equal to

64
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:56,008
the capacity of that cut, .
In fact that cuts equal to the value of

65
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:59,453
the flow, so therefore, that's the
maximum, max flow.

66
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:05,102
The value of any flow, if less or equal in
value of f, so it's the max flow.

67
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:08,392
So that proves that one implies two.
Okay.

68
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,630
Now we're going to prove two implies
three.

69
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,869
One implies two, and also two implies
three.

70
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:20,517
That also means one implies three.
So in order to prove that we're going to

71
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:25,714
prove the counter-positive.
So we'll prove that not three implies not

72
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,953
two.
That is, if there is an augmenting path

73
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:32,848
then F is not a max flow.
Well, that's pretty straightforward, then,

74
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:37,381
'cuz that's what we do in the algorithm.
We could improve the flow by sending flow

75
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,676
along the path.
So it can't be a max flow.

76
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,978
So that's, pretty easy.
If that was a max flow, there's no

77
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:47,119
augmenting path cuz if there is an
augmenting path, that's not a max flow.

78
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:52,100
So that's the, second, part of the proof.
And now the third part of the proof, will

79
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,241
prove that three implies one.
So, that'll give you, the circular logic

80
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,040
condition that proves that they're all
equivalent.

81
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:04,786
So we want to prove that if there is no
augmenting path, then there is a cut in

82
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:08,110
this capacity that equals the value of the
flow.

83
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,252
So if there's no augmenting path.
Then what we're going to have is a cut

84
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:20,394
where A is the set of vertices.
That are, connected to S by an undirected

85
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:24,660
path with no full forward or empty
backward edges.

86
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,257
And so there has to be such a cut if
there's no odd many path.

87
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:37,490
S has got to be in A and T has got to be
in B otherwise there will be a path from A

88
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:44,292
to B with no four, four front and empty
backward with edges and the capacity of

89
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:51,353
that cut equals the net flow across the
cut but all the four edges are fallen, all

90
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:58,070
the backward edges are empty so that's
exactly equal to the value of the flow.

91
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:04,682
So if there's no augmenting path then we
can demonstrate a cut whose capacity

92
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:11,294
equals the value of the flow and that is
completes the proof of the max flow and

93
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:13,780
the cut theorem.
Sorry.

94
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:19,067
Alright.
So the one last step is if we have

95
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:26,944
computed a max-flow, then what we can do
is compute the min-cut by computing the

96
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:33,355
set of vertices.
And we can do that just by a graph search.

97
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:41,148
We start at S and if there's a path that
has no, has a, a forward edge that's not

98
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:47,704
full then we follow that path and if we
have a backward edge that's not empty, we

99
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:52,155
follow the path.
And we just do a, a graph search to get to

100
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:57,780
all the vertices that we can reach with
forward edges that aren't full, and

101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,334
backward edges that aren't empty.
And then we treat the full forward edges

102
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,507
and the back empty edges as not being
there.

103
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,897
Otherwise, we do just a regular graph
search.

104
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:18,882
And that's, going to give us, the, the,
then the set of edges that define by that

105
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:24,610
cut are going to be the min-cut.
So, not difficult to compute a min-cut

106
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,132
from a max-flow.
So that's a proof of the augmenting path

107
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:31,620
there min, max-flow min-cut there.
