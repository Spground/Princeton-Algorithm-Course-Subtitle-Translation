1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,476
My key index counter is a great algorithm
but that's not the end of the story.

2
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:12,089
It's also useful for creating a more
general purpose algorithm for strings.

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,947
The first one we'll look at is called LSD
radix sort, Least Significant Digit for

4
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:20,957
string sorting.
And the idea is a very simple one.

5
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:28,301
We have strings so we're gonna consider
now a small example where the strings are

6
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:33,700
all the same length.
And again that's often true in practical

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,420
applications account numbers and so forth.
String that uses, sort these, may all be

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,580
the same length.
And what we're gonna do is consider.

9
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:49,173
The character positions in the strings,
and move from right to left.

10
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:55,685
The algorithm, is to just stably sort
using key index counting, on, the chara-,

11
00:00:55,685 --> 00:01:02,504
deed character of the key, where deed goes
from the right end and decreases.

12
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:08,207
So, this is, a stable sort.
Of those twelve keys, sorting on the

13
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:14,531
right-most character, the B's go before
the D's go before the Es.

14
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:22,256
It's crucial that the sort be stable in
this application, and that's why we

15
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:26,820
checked with key index counting to make
sure that it was stable.

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,070
So it's a stable sort on, on the right
most character.

17
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:37,567
And then all we do is move from right to
left and do now the second character.

18
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:43,421
And this now is a stable sort of those
same keys on the second character.

19
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:49,677
So now the ones with A in the second
character come before the one with B and

20
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,767
so-forth.
And not only that, it's stable, so their

21
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:58,660
relative order is maintained, BAB, CAB,
FAD, BAD, and so-forth.

22
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:01,782
And then.
To finish this.

23
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:06,050
Sort.
Now we do it on the first key.

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,141
And the magic of LSD radix sorting is eh,
once you do it on the first key then the

25
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:17,740
strings are all sorted.
So, that's three passes, one for each

26
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,727
character in the string.
Each taking linear time and we get a

27
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,910
string sort.
That's LSD sort.

28
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:32,192
Now we need to prove that it works.
And so this is a simple proof by induction

29
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:37,047
that it worked.
After we have done I passes then we can

30
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:43,157
assume by induction that the strings are
sorted on the last I characters.

31
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:50,269
So we are just showing that for two, after
two passes. it sorted on the last two

32
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:54,038
characters thats we're assuming by
induction.

33
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:58,810
So now what about the next character that
we are sorting.

34
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:04,219
Well, there's two things that can happen.
If two strings are different on the first

35
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,416
key, then, the key index sound is gonna do
the job.

36
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:12,396
A string that starts with B is gonna come
before one that starts with a D, and so

37
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:15,223
forth.
So if they're different on the sort key,

38
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:20,607
the key index sort puts them in order.
If they're the same on a sort key then

39
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:25,179
stability does the job.
So all the ones with that stay on order

40
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:31,129
because we've insisted on a stable sort.
That's a simple proof by induction that

41
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,482
LSD string sorts fixed length strings in a
descending order.

42
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,550
And it's really easy to implement.
This is a complete.

43
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,580
Java implementation of LSD string sort.
So we're explicitly working with radix

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,736
r256.
=

45
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:53,766
256 and where the radix comes in, the
value of the radix comes in, is that's the

46
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:58,765
size of the array that we use for the,
counts and the accumulants.

47
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:04,780
We need one for each character.
For each possible character value, we're

48
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,841
gonna index into that array that has to be
that big.

49
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:13,060
And all this is, is the code for key index
counting.

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:21,232
And then all we do is take a variable t
that goes down from this is the strings of

51
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:27,570
fixed width w And we start at the
rightmost character and go down to the

52
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,741
first character.
And instead of dealing with a-ah, our

53
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:40,080
string A of I2 we're just look at the deed
character which is a character.

54
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:46,431
Otherwise just with that replacement and
that replacement it's the same code as we

55
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:52,404
looked at for key index counting.
So let's do key index counting on the deed

56
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:57,303
character going down from the width from
right to left.

57
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:04,048
That's remarkably compact code.
And that's gonna be the method of choice

58
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:09,510
for lots of situations with fixed length
keys as the sort key.

59
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:18,921
And, and it gives us another look at the
performance of sorting out algorithms.

60
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:27,860
That gives us another line in the table
that we're requiring that, that be, they

61
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,076
be fixed length keys, there's ways to work
around that.

62
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:37,696
And we'll consider another algorithm that
deals with that in a minute.

63
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,430
But again it's often or typically the case
that the.

64
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,834
Width of the keys is not that long.
It's a small constant.

65
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,555
And therefore, we have a linear time
algorithm.

66
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:56,782
This even works if the keys are binary
numbers represented in a binary word.

67
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,693
We can break them up into groups of small
number of bytes Say, 64 byte number can be

68
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:09,085
broken up into 88 eight bytes characters
or four sixteen byte characters.

69
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:15,920
For sixteen byte characters, W would be
four and you can get a huge array of that

70
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,920
kind of numbers sorted in just the four
passes through the array.

71
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,702
If they don't have the same length we have
to do some extra work.

72
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,153
It's an interesting problem to think
about.

73
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:29,190
We're, we're gonna look at a different
method in a minute.

74
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:37,089
So here's the type of question that
somebody might could ask for a job

75
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:42,213
interview.
Actually, a web services company, every

76
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:50,646
day, might be in the position of needing
sort a million or a billion 32 bit or 64

77
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:56,411
byte integers.
And an algorithm student, in interviewing,

78
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:01,428
might could ask what sorting method do you
use?

79
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:06,751
Now, senator.
You hear Google and I like to think of the

80
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,810
presidency as a job interview.
Now it's hard to get a job. as president.

81
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,749
Right. And, and you're going through that
obviously now.

82
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:18,216
It's also hard to get a job at Google.
Right.

83
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:22,100
[laugh] We, we have questions.
And we ask our candidates questions.

84
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,372
And this one is from Larry Schwimmer.
Okay.

85
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:29,275
[laugh].
You guys think I am kidding?

86
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:35,914
It's right here.
What is the most efficient way to sort a

87
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:43,271
million 32 bit integers?
Well I, no, no, no, no, no, I, I think the

88
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:51,073
bubble sort would be the wrong way to go.
Come on, who told him this?

89
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:55,755
Okay.
I didn't see computer science in the

90
00:07:55,755 --> 00:08:00,548
background.
We've got our spies in there.

91
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:01,803
Well.
'Kay.

92
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:04,868
Let's ask, let's ask a different interview
[laugh] question.

93
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:08,757
[laugh].
So the bottom line is if you want a good

94
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:12,560
job maybe, you wanna know about LSD string
sort.

95
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:17,764
Actually, this method has been around for,
really a long time.

96
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,309
So we'll start with a little bit of a
story.

97
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:27,644
So what did people do, in the nineteenth
century when, they wanted to take a

98
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:31,566
census?
And actually, the story is that, for the

99
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:36,620
1880 census, it was actually obsolete,
before it was completed.

100
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,529
It took 1,500 people seven years to
manually process the data.

101
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:49,187
So, during that time there was room for
some invention, and a man named Herman

102
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:57,979
Hollerith developed an automated machine
that could help do the census faster.

103
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:04,540
So what his idea was to use punch cards to
record data.

104
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:08,365
The kind of data that was taken in the
census.

105
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,690
And then the machine could tabulate the
data by sorting one column at, at time.

106
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:19,369
And we'll look a byte at how it does that
in just a minute.

107
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:25,657
And the idea was that the re-, result of
that was that the next census finish

108
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:32,019
really much earlier and under budget,
'cause this machine automated much of the

109
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,186
process.
And that had a really a profound effect on

110
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:42,621
the development of computing 'cause punch
cards, it turned out were useful not just

111
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,765
for census but for many other
applications.

112
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:52,610
For accounting and for many other for
business processes and for many decades,

113
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:59,470
punch cards were the primary medium that
was used to store, enter, and process

114
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,658
data.
And Hollerith's company for building this

115
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:08,469
machine later emerged with a bunch of
other companies.

116
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:12,479
And in 1924 that company became known as
IBM.

117
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:19,250
And actually, punch cards were used up
into the 70's' And even in the 80's' in

118
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,709
some places.
So, if, it's important.

119
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:28,204
Let's take a little break and talk about
the role of LSD string sort.

120
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:34,815
For you know, a couple of decades people
who wrote programs were working with

121
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:39,434
punched cards.
And in courses at universities, if you

122
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:46,101
want to write a program, you wrote it by
putting one line on each punched card.

123
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:51,742
In your program, therefore, was a deck, a
long deck of punched cards.

124
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:56,700
If you had a 1000 line program, you had
1000 punched cards.

125
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,397
They came in boxes that held 2,000, and
people would carry around these boxes of

126
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,863
punch cards that, that were their
programs.

127
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:08,618
To enter the program there was a thing
called a card punch which had a, which had

128
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:13,315
a keyboard kind of like a typewriter, but
all it did, you could see the cards, and

129
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:16,780
it'd actually punche holes in the card
with what you typed.

130
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,425
Now there was a huge so then, you, you're
program was punched cards.

131
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:26,521
And there was a machine called a card
reader which would take the cards in and

132
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:32,199
convert those punches back into, into
binary and characters that again, could be

133
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:38,070
processed on the computer and then you get
your results printed out on paper in a

134
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,747
line printer.
So for many, many years people programmed

135
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:47,360
by making decks of punched cards handing
them to an operator who put them on a card

136
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,416
reader and then waiting for the printed
output to come out.

137
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,076
There were other devices, but this was the
main thing for a long time.

138
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,570
And lots of people learned to program this
way.

139
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,906
Now, there was a huge flaw in the system
though.

140
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:06,799
The flaw was, if you dropped the deck,
then your program was completely scrambled

141
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,064
and out of order.
And you had no program.

142
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:15,815
You had to go through the cards and find
the first line and, then find the second

143
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:19,152
line.
Well, people figured out to work around

144
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:24,476
for this really almost right from the
beginning, cause this is clearly

145
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:31,150
intolerable, situation, and, the, along
with the same room with the card punch,

146
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:38,023
There was a thing called a card sorter,
And the card punch did one other thing

147
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,240
automatically. every time you punched a
card.

148
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:47,370
It would go to the last six columns of the
card and it would put in, a number.

149
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:52,069
Actually they skip by ten So, it would be.
The first card would be card ten then

150
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:57,734
twenty, 30. And your cards would be
numbered up to six digits, so you could

151
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:03,051
have thousands of cards sequentially.
So when you typed in your program, you get

152
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:07,318
the cards numbered, in order.
If you wanted to add a few lines to a

153
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:12,265
program, you had room to add a couple of
numbers and, re-punch the numbers, but,

154
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:16,902
nuh, the whole point was, that all the
time when you're holding on to a card

155
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:21,169
deck, the cards are in order, by number on
the right hand column.

156
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,570
And if you dropped it, all you needed to
do was sort it.

157
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:29,325
Or if the m-, machine operator dropped it,
that was not viewed as a big deal for your

158
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:33,752
cards to get [laugh] out of order, because
there was this machine that could sort

159
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:38,232
cards.
And the way that it worked was, LSD Rate

160
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:43,848
exort, the LSD string sort on those
characters that are the numbers that keep

161
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:47,398
the card in order.
They would, you'ld start on the right

162
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:50,287
column.
And there was a physical thing, you'd set

163
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,882
to a call and, it was gonna sort on, you
put the deck in, and it'd distribute, the

164
00:13:55,882 --> 00:14:00,258
ones with zero in the first bin, or ones
with one in the second bin, all the way

165
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:04,469
up, it'd, and of all the cards it start
with zero would come in, and it was

166
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,790
stable, whatever order the cards were in,
that's the order they'd appear in the

167
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,944
pile, and then you'd pick them up, and
you'd have a new deck, and it'd be all

168
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:17,932
sorted on the right-most column.
Then you move over for one position from

169
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:21,247
right to left, and run the cards through
again.

170
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:27,589
So if running the cards through the card
sorter six times, you could get your deck

171
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:31,192
sorted.
So, every programmer knew LSD radix sort.

172
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:37,390
For decades, it was not something that
was, difficult to teach, 40 years ago.

173
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:41,858
And, these, this equipment, is now all
pretty much gone.

174
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:50,433
But LSD radix sort, is still a good
algorithm to know. Not related is

175
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,780
something else that was going on with
those initials at that time.
