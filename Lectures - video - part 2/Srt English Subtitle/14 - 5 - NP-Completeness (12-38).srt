1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,605
Now we're going to look at MP
completeness, which is, another idea that

2
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:17,432
gives us even, even stronger, evidence
that the problems that we can reduce that

3
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:25,614
to are difficult. and MP completeness is a
simple idea. it sounds almost, crazy.

4
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:33,352
It's, asking for a lot. an MP problem is
MP complete if every single problem in MP

5
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:40,385
polynomial time reduces to that problem.
that sounds like a fairly abstract

6
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:48,800
concept, but in 1970's, right about the
time Ed Karp was working Cook proved, just

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,208
before actually Cook proved, and later
Levine, a few years later, independently

8
00:00:56,483 --> 00:01:05,549
that sat is MP complete. so every problem
in NP polynomial time reduces to sat. Hm.

9
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,755
Well, that has profound implications that
I'll talk about on the next slide. But

10
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:18,034
first let's take a look at the Cook Levin
theorem. Mm, this is an extremely brief

11
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:24,824
proof sketch, but the idea of the theorem
is. I can, I can describe the idea of the

12
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:30,884
theorem. The execution of it is a tour de
force in both cases, but the idea I can

13
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:37,065
describe. the, so, a problem in NP. NNP is
one that can be solved in polynominal time

14
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:42,605
by a non-determinate Turing machine. Well,
what's a non-determinate Turing machine

15
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:48,008
exactly? Well, it's just a set of states
and symbols and, if you in a table

16
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:53,412
basically that says if you have a certain
symbols or a certain state, you go to

17
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:59,153
another table. Out of state. so actually,
and actually at the beginning the way

18
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:05,602
mathematicians thought of turing machines
was not with diagrams but just as topals,

19
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:11,472
as a list of every state, it's a list of
other states and symbols and things, just

20
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:17,922
following certain rules. so description of
a Turing machine is a formal description

21
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:23,937
of a bunch of rules with logically saying
what happens and, and there's not much

22
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:29,925
that happens. if you're in a state and you
see a symbol, go to another state, move

23
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:35,979
the tape head, and so forth. simple formal
rules. so what Cook found was that, so

24
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:42,600
anything that you can compute in, with a
non-deterministic Turing machine, anything

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,001
that you can compute you can write down on
non deterministic turing machine for, and

26
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:54,868
what Co okay found was a way to encode a
non deterministic turing machine as an

27
00:02:54,868 --> 00:03:00,964
instance of SAT and so what does that
mean. It's just writing down what a Turing

28
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:07,061
machine is in kind of a different notation
as an instance of SAT. What does that

29
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:12,521
imply? Well if you could solve that
instance of sat in polynomial time. you're

30
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:17,320
simulating operation of that Turing
machine. and you could solve, the

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,347
computation that Turing machine's trying
to do in polynomial time. That's the

32
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:27,713
sketch of, the Cook-Levin theorem.
anything that you can compute in a, on a

33
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:33,011
non-deterministic Turing Machine in
polynomial time. you can write as a SAT

34
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:38,105
instance that you could solve in
polynomial time. if you could solve the

35
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:43,743
SAT instance quickly, you could do the non
deterministic Turing Machine computation

36
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:48,565
quickly. So any problem in NP, polynomial
time reduces to SAT. That's the,

37
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:56,800
Cook-Levin theorem. And if you combine
that which was done immediately with

38
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,976
Karp's observation, well first of all it
means that, that there's a polynomial time

39
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:09,414
algorithm for SAT, if and only if P equals
NP. so that is non-determined, only if

40
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:14,454
it's non-determined, doesn't help. You
have the polynomial time algorithm for

41
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:21,164
SAT. because polynomial time algorithm for
SAT immediately means you could solve, all

42
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:27,683
problems, in NP in polynomial time. That's
what, that's what Cook's Theorem's about.

43
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:34,651
so, and NP completes getting into the
popular culture, as well. but what is the

44
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:40,646
implications? It's means all of these
thousands and thousands of problems all of

45
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:48,114
a sudden reduce to SAT. and that means
they're all equivalent. they're all

46
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:54,235
manifestations of the, of the same
problem. if you could solve any one of

47
00:04:54,235 --> 00:05:00,341
these problems in polynomial time, then it
means that you can solve them all in

48
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:07,005
polynomial time. That's a very profound
result. particularly because thousands and

49
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:13,076
thousands and thousands of important
scientific problems, all the problems that

50
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:18,999
we aspire to compute with feasible,
feasible algorithms, they're all in the

51
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:25,070
same class. if we could solve any one of
them in polynomial time, we could solve

52
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,821
all of them in polynomial time. so, what
are the implications of MP completeness?

53
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:38,939
So, it's the idea that SAT captures the
difficulty of the whole class, NP. and if,

54
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:45,053
either way, if you can prove that there's
some problem, in NP, that there's no

55
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:51,289
polynomial time algorithm for, then it's
not going to be first half. And the other

56
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,733
thing as I mentioned you can replace SAT
with any problem that has been reduced

57
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:03,428
down from SAT. Not just Karp's problems,
but any of the thousands. so, so now,

58
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:09,798
nowadays proving a problem in p-complete
was actually many examples where it's

59
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:17,067
actually guided what scientists do because
it is saying something profound about the,

60
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:24,804
profoundly important about the problem. so
here's an example. I. I'm getting to that

61
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:31,372
Ising spin model that I referred to. it
was introduced in the'20s and people liked

62
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:37,263
the model and they wanted to apply it and
trying to compute with it but it's one

63
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:42,747
thing to have a model, it's another thing
to apply the model, try to say something

64
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:48,096
about the real world that might involve
some computation. so in the'40s a

65
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:53,378
mathematical solution was found tour de
force paper, which is fine, but in the

66
00:06:53,378 --> 00:07:00,137
real world it's 3D and a lot of smart
people looked for. 3D solution to this

67
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:08,774
problem. turns out to be In 2000 it was
proven to be MP complete. And people work

68
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:18,122
for 50 years trying to solve this problem.
and . now we understand why they were

69
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:25,741
unsuccessful. Because if they had been
successful it would imply that, all those,

70
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:32,668
all those other problems are going to be
running in polynomial time. Or it would

71
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:35,958
imply that PNP.
Equals NP, and nobody believes that PNP.

72
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:44,165
Equals NP. . So here we are. We're still
with this, overwhelming consensus that P

73
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:50,482
is not equal to MP. and not only that if P
is not equal to MP, then MP complete

74
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:57,500
problems are some other subset, of MP, and
there's as I mentioned a zoo of complexity

75
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,129
classes, at the, end of the reduction
lecture a lot of them are, starting from

76
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:10,601
this diagram, you can come up with, many,
many other ideas to try to get at it and

77
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:16,762
there's not a lot of problems that people
ev en have any kind of conjecture for

78
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:22,976
falling outside. Even though it seems like
obvious there ought to be lots of problems

79
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:28,446
in MP that are not in. It's quite a
frustrating situation for people working

80
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:34,204
in the field. So the right hand diagram's
simple. The left hand diagram gets more

81
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:40,250
and more complicated as people work on it.
But really, the fundamental reason that we

82
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,080
believe that p equals, not equals MP, gets
back to that creativity. And I'd like to

83
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,195
read a quote from Avi Gregerson, who have
at the Institute for Advance Science here

84
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:57,262
in Princeton, We admire Wiles' proof of
Fermat's last theorem, and the scientific

85
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:02,281
theories of Newton, Einstein, Darwin,
Watson and Crick. The design of the Golden

86
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:07,560
Gate Bridge and the Pyramids, precisely
because they seem to require a leap which

87
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,905
cannot be made by everyone, let alone by a
simple mechanical device. It's all about,

88
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:18,201
it's a lot more difficult to create
something than to check that it's good. So

89
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:24,556
here's the summary P's the class of search
problems that are solvable in polynomial

90
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:30,345
time. Np's the class of all search
problems and some of which seem pretty

91
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:36,629
hard and people have tried really hard to
work on'em. NP complete in a sense are

92
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,630
the, the hardest problems in NP'cause you
know, all the problems in NP reduce to

93
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:49,989
those problems. we talk about a problem
having no polynomial prime algorithm, that

94
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:56,484
is intractable, er, you know. And. we know
that, lots and lots of fundamental

95
00:09:56,484 --> 00:10:03,277
problems are NP complete. so what we want
to do is use theory as a guide, when we're

96
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:09,344
confronting problems. everyone has to
realize that a polynomial time for

97
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:14,918
algorithm for an NP complete problem would
be a stunning. Scientific breakthrough win

98
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:21,125
a million dollars in this video thinks he
can do it. certainly you will confront NP

99
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:27,194
complete problems sometimes there's
thousands and thousands and thousand of

100
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:33,062
them out there. and probably a good idea,
safe bet is to assume that P is not equal

101
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:38,729
to NP because almost everyone believes
that and therefore that there is NP comply

102
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:44,188
problems are very intractable. You're not
going to be able to guarantee polynomial

103
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:49,440
running time for an algorithm. So, you
better know about those situations and

104
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,967
proceed accordingly. And, and we'll look
at a couple of things to do. around in the

105
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:01,590
1980s came to Princeton to start their
computer science department and we built

106
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,017
this building. And they asked you know, a
lot of the buildings there, nobody asked.

107
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:12,379
A lot of the buildings at Princeton have
gargoyles, and I wanted to have something

108
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:17,740
on our building that could stand the test
of time, and this is what we wound up

109
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,644
with, in a pattern on the brick up on the
top of the building. Now I could just

110
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:28,398
leave that there and maybe these count,
the solution will get edited out. And so

111
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:33,910
the, you can work on figuring out what
that means. But, you know, anyway, here's

112
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,790
the solution. the indented bricks are
ones. I mean, ones that aren't indented

113
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,444
are zeros in this little pattern. and
they're just asking. encoding. So the top

114
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:54,888
row is asking for P. and then the second
one is asking for equal and then N. and

115
00:11:54,888 --> 00:12:01,274
then another P. and then, a question mark.
so it seemed to me like that pattern,

116
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:07,968
would span the test of time and that was
that was over 25 years ago. now if,

117
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:14,662
everyone asks, what do you do, if somebody
proves that in fact P equals NP. Well in

118
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:21,125
that case we can put an exclamation point
on there. If somebody proves that P is not

119
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:26,815
equivalent P then we're going to have to
remove a lot of bricks. that's an, an

120
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:30,260
introduction to the theory of
intractability.
