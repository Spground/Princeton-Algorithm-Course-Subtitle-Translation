00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,180
Today we're gonna finish off our
discussion of graph processing by looking

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,910
at Max Flow algorithms.
This is another general problem solving

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,995
model for which we have efficient
algorithms, so where at the difference

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:20,613
between having a good algorithm and not
having one makes a difference between

5
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:25,468
being able to solve all kinds of practical
problems and not being able to address

6
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:28,547
them at all.
As an introduction we'll take a look at

7
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,507
what the problem is and some of it's
implications.

8
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:35,060
So first we'll start with what's called
the mincut problem.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:43,454
So this is a. takes as input a Edge
Weighted Digraph and now we are going to

10
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:48,795
assume that the edge weights are positive,
and we referred to the weight as a

11
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,188
capacity and you will see why in just a
minute.

12
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:55,941
And also we specify a source and a target
vertex.

13
00:00:55,941 --> 00:01:01,788
This is not an absolute requirement but it
will simplify our discussion for the

14
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:05,181
lecture.
So we have an edge weighted digraph where

15
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:10,090
the source and target vertex and every
edge has a positive capacity.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:17,663
Now a cut, an ST cut, S and T are
specified remember? Is the partition of

17
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:24,856
the vertices into two disjoint sets,
Where s is one set and t is in the other.

18
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:31,336
And we'll indicate a cut as we've done
before by coloring the vertices in one

19
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:35,075
set.
So in this case, the cut consists of s in

20
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:39,062
one set, and all the other vertices in the
other.

21
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:44,130
So s is in, one set and t is in the other,
that's an st cut.

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,860
Now given a cut.
We talk about the capacity of the cut.

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,645
And that's gonna be the sum of the
capacity of the edges that go from the set

24
00:01:54,645 --> 00:02:01,043
containing s to the set containing b If
you have edge going the other way we don't

25
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:04,896
count it.
So in this case, the, this cut with the

26
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:11,208
vertex containing just s in one set has
capacity 30 ten + five +fifteen.

27
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:15,687
Here's another cut this one contains three
vertices,

28
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:21,545
S and two at the bottom there.
Again it's an ST cut, cause s is colored t

29
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,476
is not.
And then we can look at the capacity of

30
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:29,070
that cut.
Again, we count the vertic, the edges that

31
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,761
go from to the cut containing s to the cup
containing b, B.

32
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,836
In this case, is ten + eight + sixteen
That's the edges going out is 34.

33
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:41,857
That's the capacity.
We don't count the edges that go in from

34
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:48,580
the sec containing t to the sec containing
s Capacity of the cut is the sum of the

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,084
capacities of the edges going out.
Here's the third example, and this one's

36
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:58,752
got capacity 28.
Now the three cuts that we've seen you

37
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:02,317
notice have different capacities: 30, 34,
28.

38
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:07,919
So the mincut problem, clearly, is to find
the minimum capacity cut.

39
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:14,624
Find a way to divide the vertices into two
sets, one containing s and the other

40
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:20,820
containing t with the property that the
capacity of the cut is minimized.

41
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,239
That's the mincut problem.
And this an important practical problem

42
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,670
with all kinds of applications.
Just for fun we take an application from

43
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,614
the 1950's.
This is around time these sorts of

44
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:42,701
problems were first articulated.
So this is, has to do with the cold war

45
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:49,989
and these are rail networks that connects
the Soviet Union with countries in Eastern

46
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,376
Europe.
This map actually wasn't declassified

47
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:58,993
until 1999.
But it shows a graph with the vertices,

48
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:06,842
directed graph with vertices corresponding
to cities and edges corresponding to rail

49
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:11,182
lines.
And if you look closely, you can see that,

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,990
Each of the edges is labeled with a
capacity.

51
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:19,655
The goal.
So the goal of the free world say if there

52
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:26,733
was gonna be a real war was to find a way
to cut the Soviet Union from Eastern

53
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,387
Europe.
And they wanna do that.

54
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:36,545
You can assume maybe the cost of cutting a
rail line is proportional to its capacity.

55
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:41,050
So they wanna find the cheapest way to cut
off supplies.

56
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,510
From Soviet Union, Eastern Europe.
That's an example of a min cut

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,696
application.
We'll look at some other applications

58
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:52,655
later on.
Well, look at a future, well maybe this is

59
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:57,692
a cut for today's world.
So now you have a huge graph, maybe a

60
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:02,233
social network.
And maybe there's a government and power

61
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:09,004
in some area of the world, and the goal of
that government would be to cut off the

62
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:15,115
communication to some set of people.
And again, they want to do that in the

63
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:19,573
cheapest way possible.
Find the minimum way to cut off

64
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:24,112
communication.
And certainly, people are writing programs

65
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:28,622
to process graphs like this with such
goals in mind nowadays.

66
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:34,260
These are huge, huge graphs and certainly
are going to need efficient algorithms.

67
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:38,824
In the 1950s, the graphs were pretty huge
by 1950s standards.

68
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:44,402
And it wanted efficient algorithms then
too, for sure, 'cause computers were

69
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,805
slower.
Alright, that's one problem.

70
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:51,578
So let's talk about a different problem,
called the max-flow problem.

71
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:57,403
And it's the same setup inputs and edge
weighted digraphs, source for text s, and

72
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:01,264
a target for text t, every edge has a
positive capacity.

73
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:05,475
And now what we're gonna talk about is
what's called a flow.

74
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:10,880
It's a assignment of values to the edges.
So, we have the capacities, and we're

75
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,951
gonna assign another integer to each edge,
called its flow.

76
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:18,040
And then flow has to satisfy two
properties.

77
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,486
The first one is that the flows have to be
positive and they can't be greater than

78
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:27,600
the capacity.
You can think of the, edges again as a

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,535
rail line containing some commodity or a
pipe containing some fluid.

80
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:37,022
So the flow is how much stuff can you put
through that edge?

81
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,509
You can more than zero but you can't put
more than capacity.

82
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:47,566
The other thing about a flow is that there
has to be local equilibrium at the

83
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:51,727
vertices.
And again that's a natural constraint to

84
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:57,869
think about stuff flowing in on rail lines
to a city and you want, you want to keep

85
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:04,617
things going the local elibrium constrains
says that the stuff coming in has to equal

86
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:11,289
the stuff going out at every vertex except
for the source everything leaves from the

87
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,494
source.
And the target, everything goes to the

88
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:20,243
target.
And those have the source has no inflow

89
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:26,696
and the target has no outflow.
So what you want is the inflow at a

90
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:33,924
vertex, say, in this example inflow at v,
there's five coming in on this edge and

91
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:39,662
five coming in on that edge. So that's a
total of ten coming in and there has to be

92
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:43,429
just ten going out.
So that's, happens on this one edge.

93
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,388
And that has to be satisfied at every
vertex.

94
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:50,257
So this flow's got five coming in there
and five going out.

95
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:54,215
Ten going in there and five going out each
way and so forth.

96
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:58,753
Every vertex except S and T.
And we can even make it true for S and T

97
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,910
by drawing an edge from T all the way back
to S.

98
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,390
So that's the max flow problem, well, the,
that's the definition of a flow, and of

99
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,667
course the max flow problem is to assign a
value to the flow.

100
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:15,210
Well that's how much stuff you can get to
the source.

101
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:19,622
To the target.
Or equivalently, how much stuff can you

102
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:25,139
push out of the source.
And so the value is how much can you get

103
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,244
into the target.
There's lots of different ways to assign

104
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:33,640
flows to the network to satisfy the
capacity equilibri-, equilibrium

105
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,937
constraint.
Which one maximizes the flow, that's the

106
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:40,040
maximum ST flow problem, or the max flow
problem.

107
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,558
So that's two different problems.
The min cut problem.

108
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:48,139
How do we cut the graph efficiently, with
a minimal amount of work.

109
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:52,653
And the max flow problem.
What's the maximum amount of stuff that we

110
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:57,101
can get through the graph?
And again, if we look at, the 1950's

111
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:00,502
graph.
What the Soviet Union wanted to do was

112
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:05,275
find a way to maximize the flow of
supplies to Eastern Europe.

113
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:11,589
Now that was their goal in this case, and
again you can see in this whole map, this

114
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:17,671
is a assignment of a flow to this network
that does maximize the flow for this

115
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,058
network,
So they figured it out.

116
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:25,986
And nowadays in the huge graph, maybe the
free world wants to do the opposite.

117
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:31,242
They want to maximize the flow of
information to some specified set of

118
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:33,669
people.
How do we get the most information in

119
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,776
there and is there another way to think of
it?

120
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,580
And again, these are huge graphs and we
want efficient algorithms.

121
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,159
So that's two problems both have an input
weighted digraph with a specified source

122
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,488
and target and then cut problem is to find
them in capacity cut and max flow problem

123
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:54,751
is find a maximum value flow.
It's a lot of computation to do for

124
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:59,203
example in the max flow problem we have to
assign a value to each edge.

125
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:04,406
So that's more work than just finding a
path as we've done in other graph

126
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:08,231
processing problems.
So it's more complicated and the amazing

127
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:13,058
thing about these two problems is that
they're actually pretty much the same

128
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:16,183
problem.
They're what we call dual.

129
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:20,609
If you solve one you're able to solve the
other.

130
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,724
So that's an introduction to max flow
