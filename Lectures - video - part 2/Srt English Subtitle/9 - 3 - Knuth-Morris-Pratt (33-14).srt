1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,540
So, the algorithm that we're going to look
at for solving the substring search

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,545
problem is called the Knuth-Morris-Pratt
algorithm.

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:15,317
It's got an interesting history that we'll
get to at the end.

4
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:20,444
But I just want to start by saying that.
This is one of the coolest algorithms that

5
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:24,629
we'll cover in this course.
And it's not an algorithm that anyone

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,281
would come up with without a lot of lotta
hard work.

7
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:32,290
But understanding this algorithm really
gives somebody an appreciation for what's

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,300
possible with careful algorithmic thinking
even for such a simple problem as this.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,821
It's a quite ingenious method.
So, here's the intuition behind the

10
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:46,610
algorithm.
So, say, we're looking for the pattern.

11
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:53,350
B followed by a bunch of a's in the text.
So we're going along and so ahm well,

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,879
we're trying to mismatch right away so
we'll move over to first position.

13
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:05,847
And we'll go BAAAA, and then we find a
mismatch at the end in this case.

14
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:11,527
So now, what the, brute force method is
going to do is back up to move over one

15
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:17,738
position if b doesn't match the a, back up
again if b doesn't match the a, and keep

16
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:26,140
going matching the first b against all
these a's before getting to the next

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,365
character in the text.
So, we've matched five characters and we

18
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:36,424
mismatched on the sixth.
But the key point is that when we got that

19
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:43,183
mismatch all we have is A's and B's.
We already matched BAAAA, four A's and we

20
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:46,822
got a mismatch so it's AB..
So, at that point we know what the

21
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:51,714
previous characters in the text are, and
we know that if we move over one position,

22
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,279
we're going to be trying to match B
against A.

23
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:59,290
So we should be able to take advantage of
that knowledge, that's the intuition on

24
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,480
the method of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt.
We don't need to back up the text pointer

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,762
in this case.
When we get the mismatch, we can just keep

26
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:13,694
going.
We don't even have to match the first b we

27
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:18,414
know it's there So,
We can just keep going in the text pointer

28
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:24,873
and start in the second pattern pointer.
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is a very

29
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:30,439
clever method that manages to always avoid
backup no matter what the pattern is.

30
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:36,485
So, let's take a look at what's involved.
It's based on the idea of building a

31
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:40,540
deterministic finite state machine for
string searching.

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,100
Now, the deterministic finite state
machine, if you're not familiar or don't

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,829
remember, it's a very simple thing.
You've got a finite number of states.

34
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:56,006
It's always in one of the states.
There's a start state and a, and a halt

35
00:02:56,006 --> 00:03:00,734
state.
And from every state, there's exactly one

36
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:06,164
transition for each possible character in
the alphabet.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:14,843
So we're, if we're in a state and we're
reading a particular character we move to

38
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:18,200
the state that is indicated by that
character.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,381
So, if we're in state two and we're
reading an A, we move to state three,

40
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:29,291
that's what this line in the table says.
If we're in state two and we read A, that

41
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:35,202
happens to be the pattern character is a,
and if we see and A, we move to state

42
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:38,705
three.
If we see AB or AC,c we go back to state

43
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,813
zero.
That's what this machine says. It says,

44
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:46,144
the tabular representation and the
graphical representation.

45
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:51,270
If we get to stage six then we just say,
except we found the pattern and you could

46
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,973
see how that is, the pattern and then if
we match the pattern character, we move

47
00:03:56,973 --> 00:04:01,160
right through this machine till we get to
the halt state.

48
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:07,007
So, let's first take a look at exactly how
the machine works to make sure that

49
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:11,772
everybody follows that.
And then we'll look at how to rebuild this

50
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:16,220
machine.
So that's our machine and that's our text

51
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,220
up at the top.
So, we start at state zero we're reading

52
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,157
in a.
What are we supposed to do if we're in

53
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:27,830
state zero and we're reading an A?
This enter the table and says, we're

54
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,340
supposed to go to state one.
So, we go to state one.

55
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,170
Every, at every step, we consume a text
character.

56
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:46,357
A.
And in the graphical representation, it

57
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:50,939
says, stay in state one.
Or in this representation, it says, if

58
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,070
you're in state one and you see an a, stay
in state one.

59
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,253
So that's what we'll do.
We'll read the a and stay in state one.

60
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:06,271
Now, we're in state one and so you can say
that in, in state one is reading a's and

61
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,222
in a way, looking for something that's not
A,

62
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:14,052
No matter how many a's you have, you'll
read them right here in state one.

63
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:19,151
So now, we're in state one and we're
reading a B and it says, go to state two

64
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,438
in that case.
So, that's where we'll go, read the B.

65
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:27,737
Now, we're in state two and reading an A,
So we go to state three and read the A.

66
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:33,815
Now, we're in state three and see a C.
In state three, when we see a C we're

67
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:40,428
supposed to go back to state zero.
That's a mismatch our pattern sees not

68
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:44,157
until the end.
So now, we have to start the search all

69
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,546
over again.
Although in the final state machine does

70
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:52,437
not know that, it's just plotting along
according to the state transitions they're

71
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:55,455
supposed to do.
So, we read the C, C, now we're back in

72
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,772
state zero.
So now, we're in state zero looking at an

73
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,101
a.
And we move to one, and read the A.

74
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,305
And then we see another A so we stay in
one and read the A.

75
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:10,157
And now we see a B, and we go to state
two, and read the B. And then we go to

76
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:13,650
state three and read the A, state three
and read the A.

77
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,014
State four and read the A.
State five and read the C.

78
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:21,090
And now, we're in state six.
And that means we found the pattern.

79
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:27,528
So, that's the simulation of what the
deterministic finite state be. that is

80
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:34,301
corresponding to this pattern would do.
And as we'll see the code for implementing

81
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:40,744
this simulation is quite simple.
That's a demo of DFA simulation.

82
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:47,676
So let's just take a quick look at what
the interpretation of what this DFA is.

83
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:55,906
So, what is it, what does it mean after we
just read the ith character of the text?

84
00:06:56,134 --> 00:07:02,686
Well the number of the state is the number
of characters in the pattern that we've

85
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,420
matched up to the current point.
So, that is it.

86
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,147
At state three, we've matched three
characters in the pattern.

87
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:17,425
And what's happened is, that we've matched
a prefix of a pattern, the first three

88
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:22,152
characters of the pattern.
It's, and actually, it's the longest

89
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:28,817
prefix of the pattern that's also a suffix
of the i, first i plus one characters from

90
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,065
the text,
Text from zero to i.

91
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:37,594
That's the interpretation of what it is.
So and if the DFA is in state three after

92
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:44,539
the first six characters of the text it's
got ABA is the longest prefix of a

93
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:47,816
pattern.
That's also a suffix of first six

94
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:52,809
characters of the text.
So, another prefix of the pattern that

95
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:59,675
looks like it might work is ABABA but
that's not a suffix of the text string

96
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:04,669
ending at character six.
And third, interpretation is useful to

97
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:11,981
understanding what's going on.
So given that we've constructed this DFA.

98
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:20,893
It's just the state transition table for
the DFA is simply a two-dimensional array.

99
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:29,335
That's indexed by the pattern character.
So, if, if you in a, a certain, if you're

100
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:37,590
reading a certain pattern character sorry,
if you're reading a certain text character

101
00:08:37,872 --> 00:03:45,841
then for each we reset the pattern pointer
to be the entry given in the table that

102
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:54,307
corresponds to the current one.
So let's go back to the table to be sure

103
00:08:54,307 --> 00:03:51,059
about that.
So when we're in a particular state like

104
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:06,000
two and we see an a we read, so this would
be j we refer to that column.

105
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:11,643
And whatever text character we happen to
see, that's how we update j.

106
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:17,210
So that's what this code does.
And then, if we ever to get to the

107
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,853
transition state, the final state, we just
return i minus m. Now, this is just like

108
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:28,344
that alternate implementation of the brute
force method that we gave.

109
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:33,950
But the key idea is that,
Notice that i never gets decremented.

110
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,700
All we're doing is incrementing i and
changing j.

111
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,777
Either always just referring to the table.
When we have a match, the table

112
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:51,830
automatically increments j.
We have a mismatch, it figures out the

113
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,417
right state to go to.
So, that's a very simple and economical

114
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:01,608
and fast implementation of substring
search.

115
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:09,058
So the running time is clearly, all it
does it look up an entry in the table for

116
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,690
every text character.
So, that's linear time.

117
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,680
The key is, is.
How do we build that table that drives the

118
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,760
algorithm?
And that's the tricky algorithm.

119
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,100
So a warning.
This is definitely the trickiest algorithm

120
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,657
we've looked at so far.
And the idea, the importance, again, of no

121
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:34,332
backup is that since the text pointer
never decrements, you could use the input

122
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:40,595
stream and just replace text [UNKNOWN]
just read the next character in the next

123
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:44,575
input stream.
And this algorithm is going to work fine,

124
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:49,660
no matter how big the input stream is.
It will just go right, right through.

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,113
Its not no memory of what the text is.
But its got some memory of what the

126
00:10:55,113 --> 00:11:00,871
pattern is that's built into the DFA.
So, this is the key that, you have a

127
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:05,202
pattern,
You can spend some time building this DFA

128
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:11,179
table and doing pre-processing.
But then, when you get the text, just,

129
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:18,109
just index into this table for every text
character and you're doing this substring

130
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:21,660
search.
So, you can build a machine that does

131
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,960
this.
No backup.

132
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:27,316
Okay.
So let's take a look at what it means to

133
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:32,226
construct this DFA.
So it depends on the pattern instead of

134
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:39,038
with one character one state for each
character in the pattern plus an extra at

135
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:43,077
substate.
And let's look at what it means to build

136
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,354
the same.
So first thing now we do to one character

137
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,077
one stage for each character in the
pattern.

138
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:56,836
So the first thing we do is deal with the
match transitions.

139
00:11:56,836 --> 00:12:00,628
So, that's when the you've, you're in
state j,

140
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:05,469
That means you've already matched j
characters in a pattern.

141
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:13,004
Then if, if the next character matches.
So that the character that you have is

142
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:17,735
the, the character that's supposed to
match.

143
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:23,794
You're going to so it's, add that
character j, that's just a j plus first

144
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:27,944
character,
Then you know that you've matched j plus

145
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:32,675
one characters.
So, all that means is we can put in the

146
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:37,486
match transitions.
So, we have ABABAC, and these guys go

147
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:44,119
ABABAC if you're in state zero and you see
an A you go to state one, if you're state

148
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:48,047
one and you see a B, you go to state two
and so forth.

149
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:55,466
That's how we get the match transitions to
get us all the way through the pattern to

150
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:59,508
the accept state.
So that's the, the easy part.

151
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:04,460
And then the hard part is the mismatch
transitions.

152
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:11,228
What are you supposed to do if you come
against a text character that does not

153
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:17,666
match the current text character?
So, for example, if you're in state zero,

154
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:22,923
the pattern starts with an A.
If you didn't see if you don't see an A as

155
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:27,340
the first character in the text,
If you see a B or a C, then obviously you

156
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,240
want to stay in state zero.
So, you can think of state zero as,

157
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,988
scanning through the text looking for an
A.

158
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:38,974
It's going to stay in, in state zero as
long as it sees a B or C as soon as it

159
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:43,577
sees an A, it'll go to state one.
That completes state zero, you know what

160
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:47,860
to do if you have a, an A, you know what
to do if you have a B or a C.

161
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,327
What about state one?
So, we know that if you're in state one,

162
00:13:54,327 --> 00:14:02,643
you saw an A in the text, and you see a B
in the text, what are you supposed to do?

163
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,750
Well there's two different cases.
If you,

164
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:14,020
If you see a B going to state two if you
see a C and that's not going to match the

165
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,867
first character A in the pattern.
So, you go back to state zero.

166
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:24,026
But if you see an A, it's just as if you
saw an A, a in state zero,

167
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:30,409
So, you might as well stay in state one.
So, that's how we fill in the DFA for

168
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,441
state one,
If you see a B going state two, you

169
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:36,743
matched.
If you see an A, well that matches the

170
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,236
first character.
So, stay in state one.

171
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:43,280
If you see a C, clearly you have to go
back to state zero.

172
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:48,931
Okay, what about the next one?
So if we're in state two and we see an A

173
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:54,153
we know that we go on to state three.
And what about the mismatch pages?

174
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:59,912
Well, in that case, it's a B or C and
again if you're sitting out a B or a c, C

175
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:04,670
you'd better go back to state zero to keep
looking for an a.

176
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:10,510
This is state three, and well, now it gets
to be a little more complicated.

177
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:15,702
C, you state three, see a B, you
succeeded, if you see a C, you go back to

178
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:19,472
state zero.
It's not so bad if you see an A, it's just

179
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:23,028
like before.
That's going to be like the first one.

180
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:26,158
So seems like we're going along pretty
fine.

181
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:30,284
And again if we're in state four, we seen
A, you go to five.

182
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:35,263
If you see a B or a C, then you better go
back and look for an A again.

183
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:39,033
This one, is the one that's a little more
complicated.

184
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:43,727
If you're in state five and you see a B
you, you go back to state four.

185
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:48,662
And that's it's a little more work to
figure out why that's the case.

186
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:52,691
And then that last case is kind of the
essence of the algorithm.

187
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:57,960
So we'll look at a systematic way to be
able to figure out what you do on a

188
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,491
mismatch in each case.
In this case, you only needed that, that

189
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:06,537
for that one state.
Otherwise, it was elementary reasoning.

190
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,429
So that's a full DFA for KnuthMorrisPratt.
A demo of at least thinking about how it's

191
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,995
going to be constructed.
Okay, let's look a little more carefully

192
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:20,790
and systematically at the construction
process for the KnuthMorrisPratt DFA.

193
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:27,556
So the, the start is clear.
We're going to go through the pattern.

194
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:31,999
And for systematically fill in the match
transitions.

195
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,531
If we're in state zero and we see an A, we
want to go state one.

196
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:43,315
If we're in state one and we see a B,
we're going to, we want to go to state

197
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:46,668
two.
State two, so we look up the pattern

198
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:52,284
character and then, whatever that one is,
we want to go to the next state.

199
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:56,560
So, we can fill in at least that much
automatically.

200
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:02,400
Now the real key is the mismatch
transition.

201
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,984
So, here is the idea of the mismatched
transition.

202
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:14,655
So if you're in stage J and you get a
mismatch, the next character in the text

203
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:19,240
does not match the jth character in the
pattern.

204
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:24,759
So as pointed out at the beginning as
motivation for KnuthMorrisPratt,

205
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,040
You know a lot about the text at that
point.

206
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,858
And you know that the last j, j minus one
characters of the text are if you lop off

207
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:39,228
the first character of the pattern, it's
from one to j minus one. So, in this case

208
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:45,120
and then, it's followed by the text
character that, that you're looking at.

209
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,600
So one thing that you could do, so what
you want to do, so you know that.

210
00:17:52,865 --> 00:18:00,647
And what you could do is simulate the DFA
that you have built on that part of the

211
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:07,457
pattern and then take the transition for
the character that you just find.

212
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:13,912
So, let's, let's look at this.
So let's run this machine, if we'd seen it

213
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:17,450
on the text of, of BABA,.
What we want to do,

214
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:25,236
We want to put the machine in the state as
if we have backed up, but we don't want to

215
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:31,340
backup. So, if we see a B, we stay in
zero, if we see an we, we go to one.

216
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,180
Then we see a B we go two.
And if we see an A, we go to three.

217
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:50,089
So now we're in state three in if we had a
mismatch then the, for the fifth

218
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:56,906
character, what we do on a, on a mismatch
here we have to look what happens if we

219
00:18:56,906 --> 00:19:02,326
get an A or we get a B.
If we'd run it on BABA and we get an A,

220
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:07,281
then we should go back to one.
So, what that says is, if we had a

221
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:12,717
mismatch and we saw an A in five we would
need to be in state one.

222
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:18,984
Because if we had, had run the thing on
the characters that we know, BABAA, we

223
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:27,285
would wind up in state one.
And similarly if we were if we got the

224
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:31,729
mismatch on a B,
A if we did BABA,, we would be in state

225
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,330
three.
And, we're in state three and we saw B

226
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,926
we'd go to four.
So again to summarize, if four instate

227
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:44,425
five and we see a C, we know that's a
match, we go to six.

228
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:50,559
If we see an A, we know that the previous
five characters in the text were BABAA.

229
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:56,450
So, we can just simulate the machine.
Babaa, we're in state one.

230
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,372
And ifwe get a mismatch that's a B, then
that's DFAB five,

231
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:07,667
Then we know that the previous five
characters in the text were BABAB. And

232
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:14,016
that would put us in state four.
So that's the simulation of BABA puts us

233
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:17,390
in state three.
If we get an A, we go to one.

234
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,313
So that means that from five, we go back
to one.

235
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:26,883
And if we get a B, we go to four.
So, that's how, one way to calculate the

236
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:32,219
mismatched transitions.
And as we've noted in the simulation, this

237
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:35,750
is the only non-trivial one for this
example.

238
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:42,362
Now, there's a little problem with that,
Is that it seems to require j steps to do

239
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:46,963
the simulation.
In order to figure out these mismatched

240
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:53,863
transitions, I had to all the way through
the pattern shifted over one to figure out

241
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:58,464
this state three.
So that seems to be a bit of a problem,

242
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:04,625
but actually it's no problem at all,
because we can run this simulation one

243
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:08,733
character at a time as we're building the
machine.

244
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:16,619
All we need to do is keep track of the
that we would be at if we had run the DFA

245
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:24,904
on the pattern starting at position one.
Once, once we get going it's pretty easy

246
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:31,378
but just let's start well, let's just
illustrate it by saying, okay,

247
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:35,829
We maintain this state x,
Which is where we would be if we if we had

248
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,350
run the machine and the pattern had
shifted over one.

249
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:45,595
Now when we come to do our mismatches to
figure out where the mismatch transitions

250
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:51,308
from five are all we do is look at if we
get, if we were to get an A, would be as

251
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:56,888
if we were to state X and got an A.
So that's one and if we were to get a B

252
00:21:56,888 --> 00:22:01,340
it's as if we were at state X and got a B.
And that's state four.

253
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,850
So, what we need to do is to compute the
mismatch transitions is keep track of

254
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,859
state x.
And that is where would the thing be if we

255
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:19,203
had run it starting with the, at the
pattern one position shifted over.

256
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:24,238
And we want to update that.
So, when we're moving to the next state,

257
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:30,588
if we had a match on C, state x gets
updated to where it would have gone if it

258
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:34,368
got a C.
Because for the next character, when we

259
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:39,206
move j over for the match on C we'll want
to have x updated.

260
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:46,312
So, that's the key is keeping track of the
state where the machine would be if we had

261
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:51,000
backed up or if we had run it on the
pattern shifted over one.

262
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,920
So let's take a look at a demo that does
the full construction for the KMP DFA.

263
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:05,522
So here, here goes.
Again, one state for every character plus

264
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:09,686
an accept.
Match transitions are easy.

265
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:16,084
We build those.
And we're going to start at position zero.

266
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:24,796
And the mismatched transitions are easy.
So now, when we move over x is when we're

267
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:30,021
in position one of the pattern, x is where
we would be if we started out without

268
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:33,170
that, that character,
Which would be the empty string.

269
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:37,600
So we start out with just filling in
zeros.

270
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:45,518
For state zero and we can do that without
any further every reason and now we've got

271
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:53,955
x initialized. so now, what we need to do
is fill in the mismatch transitions for

272
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:56,800
state one.
So, what are they?

273
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,300
They're what would happen if we found
those characters?

274
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,395
And, and we're in state x,
If we found an A, we would go to state

275
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:11,285
one.
If we found a C, we'd go to state zero.

276
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:18,882
And maybe you noticed, that's just taking
the entries corresponding to the entries

277
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:23,977
we need from x's column and putting them
in j's column.

278
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:28,702
That's all it is.
And then, we need to update x, which is

279
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:35,186
where it would be if we matched a B.
So, well stay and x will stay in state

280
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:38,188
zero.
So now let's look at state two.

281
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:44,759
So we need to fill in what would happen if
we got a B and what would happen if got a

282
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,044
C.
Well, it's what would happen if we were in

283
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:53,121
state x and we got a B or a C,
So what we'll do is move those two zeroes

284
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:57,890
over to column two.
And then don't forget we have to update x

285
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,845
and x goes where the machine goes if we
saw an A, that transitions from two to the

286
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:06,600
three.
So, we just move x to state one.

287
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:12,804
So now, we have x in state one, and we're
doing position three and now you can see

288
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:16,792
how really simple the algorithm is once it
gets going.

289
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:23,514
So now the mismatched transitions are A
and C, and that's what we have to fill for

290
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:30,430
column but those mismatched transitions
were already computed that's where x would

291
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,195
go if we, that's where it would go if we
happen to be in state one.

292
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:39,683
So, we move the one and zero from column
one over to column three.

293
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:46,050
And again, we update x and when we see a B
x goes to state two.

294
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:54,389
And, and again, you can check what, what
is x suppose to be.

295
00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:00,140
It's, it's suppose to be where you would
be if you started the machine on the

296
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,674
pattern with the first letter cut off.
So, it's, it's suppose to be where would

297
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:09,268
you wind up if you got BAB, BAB and that's
a check.

298
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:15,019
Alright, so now it's straightforward,
straightforward we have to fill in B and

299
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,206
C.
We go to x's column and copy over B and C

300
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:20,769
from x's column.
Then we update x.

301
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:24,220
That's if you see an A, you go to state
three.

302
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:29,954
Now we're ready for state five.
We've got x all computed and we need to do

303
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:32,373
A and B.
And we get those from X.

304
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:36,173
If it's an A it's a one.
And if it's a B it's a four.

305
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:42,249
It's just moved them over.
And then when we do the C and get the

306
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:49,077
accept there's no mismatch.
That's the we do update x to get ready.

307
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:57,362
But when we get to state six we're done.
And again, it's just as a doublecheck, x

308
00:26:57,362 --> 00:18:02,224
is where you'd be if you saw BABAC.bac
That's the construction of the

309
00:18:02,224 --> 00:27:07,629
Knuth-Morris-Pratt DFA efficient
algorithm.

310
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:14,220
Really ingenious and as it turns out,
simple to implement.

311
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,755
Implementation for the DFA construction
for Knuth-Morris-Pratt requires remarkably

312
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:27,976
little code so it just goes through with
what we did in the demo.

313
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:35,861
So we've got x and for every entry of the
DFA and x's column that corresponds to

314
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:41,820
everyone except for the match we just copy
x's column to j's column.

315
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:47,790
In fact, we just copy'em all, and then
overwrite one corresponding to the match

316
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,076
case, to j plus one.
So there. And the entry in the column that

317
00:27:52,076 --> 00:27:58,046
corresponds to the pattern character,
that's where do we go if we match, that's

318
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:01,720
j plus one, all the rest of them are
copied from x.

319
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,697
So, one forwarded the copy from x then set
the match case and the only other thing to

320
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:12,145
do is update x.
And how do you update x?

321
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:18,220
You take the [unknown] machine to where it
would go if it were at state x and I got

322
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:27,441
the current x pattern, pattern character.
So that's the, DFA construction amazingly

323
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:33,275
a line of code.
So the only, so flaw in this codec, is

324
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:42,711
that it does take time proportional to R
times M where are R is the radix and, and

325
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:50,481
M is the length of the pattern and, and as
we'll see this, ways to, get around this.

326
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:58,956
But for relatively small alphabets this is
no problem because the search is so

327
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:03,567
efficient this way and the construction as
well.

328
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:11,732
But if you're doing this for Unicode for a
long pattern maybe that's too much memory

329
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:19,219
to devote to the DFA representation.
So the bottom line is and this follows

330
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:25,851
immediately from examining the code is
that the substrings can be substring

331
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:31,534
search as linear time.
Your only access at most, each character

332
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:36,912
in the pattern, each character in the
texts wants quite remarkable.

333
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:42,367
Each pattern character you have accessed
once when your making the DN, DFA.

334
00:29:42,367 --> 00:09:56,096
And each text character is accessed once
when you're simulating the DFA, and that's

335
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:54,212
in the worst case.
Now the space again, is proportional to RM

336
00:29:54,212 --> 00:30:01,892
because we have all those mismatches.
It is possible to develop a version of

337
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:09,440
Knuth-Morris-Pratt that constructs the
automaton in time and space proportional

338
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,567
to M.
It's actually a non-deterministic

339
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:19,061
automaton cuz it's either a match or all
mismatches and mismatch might involve

340
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:23,952
multiple hops.
So if you are interested you can read

341
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:29,645
about that version of KMP.
But it's sufficiently more complicated

342
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:36,300
that you should be, be prepared to study
it carefully to really understand it.

343
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:42,256
This algorithm is really interesting
because of its history.

344
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:49,348
It was actually independently discovered
by two theoreticians and a hacker.

345
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:55,683
So there's Knuth who was one of the
fathers of computer science.

346
00:30:55,683 --> 00:31:02,774
Who read a paper that was a very esot by
Steve Cook, a very esoteric theoretical

347
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:09,340
result that he realized implied that it
should be possible to solve the substring

348
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,863
search problem in linear time.
The theorem really didn't give any way to

349
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:20,740
solve it but it indicated that it should
be possible to solve it in linear time.

350
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:24,068
So, Knuth worked on it and figured out a
way.

351
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,087
And then Pratt who was a student of
Knuth's at Stanford at the time figured

352
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:36,630
out a way to take care of this mismatch,
independent of the alphabet side.

353
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,124
And in the meantime, across the Bay at
Berkeley Jim Morris was busy writing a

354
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:45,559
text editor.
In those days people were using

355
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,337
typewriters.
And other people were realizing that

356
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:52,771
computers would be really good at editing
text.

357
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:57,854
And so you know,
Many people would work on text editing and

358
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:01,769
formatting systems.
Ahm it was kind of a badge of honor in

359
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,753
those times.
Morris actually worked for the computer

360
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:10,969
center at Berkeley.
And wanted to have a really bolt-proof

361
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:15,384
text editor that everyone could use.
And one of the things he wanted to do was

362
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:19,897
avoid backup.
Cuz backup was just really inconvenient,

363
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:25,231
Involved a lot of code.
And just something that he didn't want to

364
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:28,712
have.
And he basically came up with the same

365
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:33,971
algorithm and the community was kind of
small at that time.

366
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:39,305
And theory meets practice.
And that's where this paper came from

367
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:43,453
1977.
Morris, then went on to get his PHD, and

368
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:48,934
to work at Xerox Parc.
And unfortunately later on another systems

369
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:54,046
programmer came and took a look at
Morris's code and couldn't understand it,

370
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:59,609
and put the brute force algorithm back in.
But that part of the story is maybe a less

371
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,620
successful example of theory meeting
practice.

372
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,725
That's Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, one
of the most ingenious algorithms that

373
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:08,380
we'll see.
