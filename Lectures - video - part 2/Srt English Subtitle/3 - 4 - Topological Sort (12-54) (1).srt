1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,780
Now, we'll look at topological sorting.
A digraph processing application that

2
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:12,641
doesn't quite have a parallel with
undirected graphs.

3
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:18,364
And it's a very general model that is, is
very widely, widely used and here's the

4
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:21,881
simplest example of it called, precedence
scheduling.

5
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:27,052
So the idea is that you've got a set of
tasks that need to be completed,

6
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:32,533
But there's precedence constraints, and
you want to know in what order should you

7
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:38,118
schedule the tasks. so, you might think
that this is like courses in a university

8
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:42,430
curriculum.
For, so is the model we'll us the vertices

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,578
will be the task and the edges will be the
precedence constraint.

10
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:54,068
And all these says is there's an edge from
three to six, that means you have to take

11
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:59,216
introduction to Computer Science before
you take Advance Programming.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,855
And so there's so, all of these source of
constraints in a graph. and so what you

13
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,138
want is, A what's called a feasible
schedule,

14
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:15,191
So that's just an order in which you can
take the linear order, in which you can

15
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,869
take the courses one after the other that
respects the precedence.

16
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:26,105
So, that corresponds to drawing the graph,
such that all the edges point upwards.

17
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:31,774
And this model is used to study
manufacturing processes and many other

18
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:35,317
applications.
So, that's the topological sorting

19
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:39,002
problem.
So, first thing is topological sort works

20
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:43,804
on a DAG, so called DAG.
That's a digraph that has no cycles.

21
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:51,321
If you have a cycle there's no way you're
going to be able to solve the problem.

22
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:58,963
In fact we'll, simpler hraph processing
problem is just find out if a graph has a

23
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:02,057
cycle.
And we'll talk about that in a second,

24
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:07,059
But let's do topological sort first.
So we know that the graph has no cycles.

25
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:12,523
It's a directed, acyclic graph, graph,
And what we want to do is, find a way to

26
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,880
redraw the DAG, so that all the edges
point upwards,

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,286
Yh, or give, a bottom to top order so that
all the edges are pointing upward.

28
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:24,423
That's called a topological order of the
graph.

29
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:29,830
And, that'll give, in this case, an order
in which maybe you could take the courses

30
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,901
or perform the manufacturing process or
whatever else.

31
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,816
So, that's the problem.
So how are we going to solve it?

32
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:42,555
Well, we're going to use DFS.
In fact, one of the lessons for

33
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:49,206
particularly for digraph processing is DFS
is going to provide a way to solve it.

34
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:56,977
It might be hard to find a different way.
So let's look at a demo of topological

35
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:03,905
sort.
And all of this is just run DFS, but there

36
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:11,242
is a particular point in which we, we want
to take the vertices out to get the order,

37
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:17,314
and that's called reverse DFS post-order.
So, lets look at how that works.

38
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:24,483
What we do is, when we do the DFS, when we
are done with the vertex we put it on a

39
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:28,784
stack or put it out,
So, lets look at how that works.

40
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:32,615
So,
We had just run DFS the same as before,

41
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:38,401
But we're not keeping track of anything,
except the vertices that we're done with.

42
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:43,256
So, visit, visit, vertex zero.
We have to check the places that you can

43
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,106
get to it from zero.
It's one, two, and five.

44
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:54,081
So we check one, one is unmarked, so we're
going to mark it and recursively visit

45
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:58,150
one.
So we do that and we have to check four

46
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:06,039
and four again is unmarked, so we recurse.
But now both of the edges to four are in,

47
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,148
so there's nowhere to go from four, so
we're done with four.

48
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:17,650
When we're done with four, we output it,
actually put it on a stack.

49
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,996
So that's order, the order in which we're
done with the vertices.

50
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,101
That's called postorder.
So now, once we're done with four, now

51
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:34,561
we're done with one, there's no where else
to go so we put it on the post order.

52
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:41,757
And now, we're back at zero and we have to
check the other vertices that we get to

53
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:45,764
from zero.
So, here's two and get two from two, and,

54
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:50,390
it's unmarked, so we visit it.
But there's no place to go,

55
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,983
So we're done with it.
So we put it on the postorder and go back

56
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:58,798
to zero.
Then we go to five, unmarked, so we visit

57
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,049
it.
Then we check two, which is marked, so

58
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,366
nothing to do.
And then we're done with five.

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,581
And, once we're done with five, then we're
done with zero.

60
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:17,281
And that's the postorder of the vertices
that you can get to it from zero.

61
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:22,865
So now we have to check all the other
vertices in the graph,

62
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:29,566
But we have to find some other place, and
so we just check the vertices in order.

63
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:34,203
Next one that we find that's unmarked is
three.

64
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:40,785
And so to visit three, we have to check,
two, four, five, and six.

65
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:46,394
And two, four, and five, are all marked,
So nothing to do.

66
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:50,306
Six is unmarked,
So we go visit six.

67
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:57,604
When we visit six, zero and four are,
already, marked, so there's nothing to do.

68
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:03,120
Then we're done with six, And finally,
we're done with three.

69
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,936
And we're done with the vertex.
We'd put it out. That's or if we put it on

70
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:15,647
a stack, and then we get reverse postorder
and that turns out is the answer that we

71
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:20,678
need.
So the code is pretty simple but we'll

72
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:24,833
have to look a little more carefully to be
convinced that it works.

73
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,445
So it's depth-first search but we have
additional data structure, which is a

74
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:35,255
stack of integers, which is the vertices
and reverse postorder.

75
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:41,673
The constructor just creates that stack,
And then the only thing we change to DFS

76
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:48,614
is when we're done with the vertex, before
exiting, we put that vertex on the reverse

77
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:54,435
post stack. and then the client simply
gets the stack returned, that's

78
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:58,465
inevitable.
And iterating through that will give the

79
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:04,734
vertices in the reverse DFS postorder
which is the order you which is the

80
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:10,798
topologically sorted order.
It's a very simple and compelling use of

81
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:14,617
DFS.
Actually this is an amazingly simple

82
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:18,436
algorithm, but it went undiscovered for
many years.

83
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:23,630
People were using much more complicated
algorithms for this problem.

84
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,486
Okay.
So, reverse DFS postorder of a DAG is the

85
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:31,941
topological order.
That's, the correctness proof, that we

86
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:36,263
have to consider.
This diagram over here, is a record of the

87
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:39,787
recursive calls, for that example that we
just did.

88
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:43,907
To visit zero, we probably visit one, and
then we visit four.

89
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,830
And then we're done with four, and then
we're done with one.

90
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:53,679
And then we visit two, down with two, Then
do five, which checks two, And five down

91
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:57,540
and so forth.
So this gives a record of the calls, just,

92
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:01,540
For reference in this proof for that
example.

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,730
Alright. So now, we want to consider any
edge where v points to w and we want to

94
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,786
consider the point where dfs of V is
called.

95
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:20,293
And there's a bunch of cases.
So one case is that dfs w, has already

96
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:26,320
been called and returned.
So in this example, when v equals three, w

97
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,500
equals two, four, or five, they were
already done.

98
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,903
So, if we put out, those vertex numbers,
before we put, three out, then the arrow

99
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:43,798
from v to w is going to point up.
They were already done.

100
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:49,223
So that's case one. That's an easy case.
Case two, they're all easy cases.

101
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:55,956
[laugh] Case two is, dfs w hasn't, been
called yet, but if there's an edge from v

102
00:08:55,956 --> 00:09:02,954
to w we're going call it and then recurse,
it's going to finish before we're done

103
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:07,699
with three.
So again, the edge from v to w is going to

104
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:13,482
point out, three to six.
And the only other possible case might be

105
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:18,070
that, dfs w is already been called but not
returned.

106
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:23,690
But that can't happen,
In, because there's no cycles.

107
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,220
If d, dfs w had been called but not yet
returned,

108
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:35,718
Then the function call stack is going to,
from it's, it's going to have path from w

109
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:39,868
to v on it.
And so. if we have an edge v-w, that would

110
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:46,288
give a cycle, but there is no cycles.
So from those observations we know that

111
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:51,221
all vertices pointing from three are done
before three is done,

112
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:57,093
So they appear after three in the
topological order, or they point up if we

113
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,400
put the vertices in reverse topological
order.

114
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:07,625
So that's the correctness proof for
topological order.

115
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,304
So, a similar, process, is, to detect a
cycle.

116
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:15,187
A topological sort doesn't work if a
graph's got a cycle,

117
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:20,433
So one of the things we might want to do
is, just, find cycles in digraphs.

118
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:25,951
Now, if you're a college and you put out a
curriculum that's got a directed cycle,

119
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:29,971
you have your problem so you might want to
process that first.

120
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:32,785
So,
If there's a directed cycle, you can't

121
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:36,901
have a topological order.
If there's no directed cycle then we've

122
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,257
just found it.
So, one thing you might want, is given a

123
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:44,309
digraph, find a directed cycle.
And how are you going to do that?

124
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:49,184
You're going to use DFS and that's a
simple algorithm that you might want to

125
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,540
think about and,
It's in a few lines in the book.

126
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:00,888
So, precedence scheduling is a, an
excellent example of the use of search

127
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:07,663
directed graph,
And, this is the cycle of length one.

128
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:13,712
Of course, that requires itself as a
prerequisite.

129
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:20,730
And, this is just an example of a very
widely computation.

130
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,303
And it really has many, many applications.
So for example, the Java compiler actually

131
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:31,661
does cycle con, detection.
If you have a class A extends B, and

132
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:35,635
another one B extends C, and another one C
extends A,

133
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:41,139
That's going to create a problem.
Class hierarchies are not supposed to have

134
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,885
cycles,
And it'll actually, the Java compiler will

135
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:50,006
actually give a, an error message saying
there's cyclic inheritance.

136
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:56,643
You're not allowed to do that.
So there's many applications that involve

137
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:01,872
essentially digraphs that aren't supposed
to add cycles.

138
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:10,027
Another example is Microsoft Excel.
So if you do cyclic reference like this in

139
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:19,543
Excel, which in a big spreadsheet, now you
can imagine might .. that's, that's an

140
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:24,995
error,
And not only this Microsoft Excel flag the

141
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,191
error.
It says you have, created a circular

142
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:34,261
reference, try one of the following,
And it's actually got a circular reference

143
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:39,392
toolbar, that will help you figure out,
what to do, in that case.

144
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:44,884
So, cycle detection and topological
sorting are important applications in

145
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,980
depth-first and digraphs.
