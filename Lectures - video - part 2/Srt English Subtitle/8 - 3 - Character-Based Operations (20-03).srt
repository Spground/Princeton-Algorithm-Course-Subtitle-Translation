1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:11,076
Now, we're going to finish up by looking
at some extra operations that are

2
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:15,334
supported for string keys when we use
Tries.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,533
So, we're going to look at a couple of
character based operations that can, that

4
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:30,180
are quite useful and, and can be supported
by the string symbol table API with tries.

5
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:37,739
One important one is a prefix match.
So that's given a prefix, like say sh,

6
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:42,710
What we want is the method to return all
the keys.

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,236
Let's start with that prefix.
In this case, it'll be shells, shore and

8
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:53,149
she.
Another one is so-called wild card match.

9
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:59,776
So that's when we don't specify one of the
characters, or multiple characters.

10
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:06,921
So we put a dot to say we'll take any key
that matches the other characters and we

11
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,999
don't care what that one is.
So he. would match she and the.

12
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,873
And another one is so-called longest
prefix.

13
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:23,103
So now we've got a long key and we want to
find the best match that's in our symbol

14
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:28,251
table that matches that key.
The key in the symbol table that has the

15
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:32,613
longest match with our key.
So going, in this case, the ones that's

16
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,567
the longest prefix of shells sort is
shells.

17
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:41,406
Later on we're going to see applications
of some of these and the important idea

18
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:44,426
for now is that these are easy to
articulate.

19
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:49,300
And not only that, they're easy to
implement with tries.

20
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:57,313
Nts tr, and Turner research tree.
So, we're going to take our standard API

21
00:01:57,313 --> 00:02:03,916
and add these four methods.
So, while there's keys that returns all

22
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,607
keys.
And, and, as is our usual practice.

23
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:11,530
When we have a lot of things to return,
we're going to return'em as a, as an

24
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,141
iterable.
So the clients can just, iterate through

25
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:19,670
the what's returned.
And that's usually what clients want to

26
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,098
do.
And then we have keys with prefix.

27
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:27,415
Give a string s, and the iterable will
return all the keys in the symbol table

28
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:31,813
that have s as a prefix.
If the client wants to find the associated

29
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:34,570
values, they can do gets to get the
values.

30
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,272
And then we have keys that match so that's
where we allowed dot to be a wild card, in

31
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:47,679
S, and we want to return all the keys
that, match, S, taking dot to be a wild

32
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:51,215
card.
And then longest prefix of S is the key in

33
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:56,002
there that's the longest prefix of S.
We're gonna see later on.

34
00:02:56,002 --> 00:03:01,673
This particular one plays, an important,
role in a, in a more complicated

35
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:05,312
algorithm.
We could also go ahead and add all the

36
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:10,840
ordered symbol table methods that we
considered when we looked at binary search

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,816
trees like floor, and, and rank.
And, we're not going to take time to do

38
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,650
that right now.
It's very straightforward.

39
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:26,436
So one thing that we haven't really talked
about but it's a good warm up for the

40
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:29,550
kinds of methods that we're going to look
up.

41
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,709
Look at for these implementations is
ordered iteration.

42
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:44,331
And this is trie-traversal, so we are
going to do an in-order traversal of the

43
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:51,498
trie, that is, visit the left, now visit
the middle, visit the right.

44
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:59,792
In that traversal, we can maintain the
sequence of characters on the path from

45
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:05,643
the root to the current node just by
adding an, adding a character when we go

46
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,862
down and removing a character when we go
up.

47
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:15,882
And when we encounter values,
Then we can put out this, the characters

48
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:21,686
that we have, and that's the way to pull
out all the keys in the trie.

49
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:27,006
So, for example, in this case we go down
and we have b, and then we hit the y's.

50
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:31,096
So we can output,.
Say onto a queue we can output by.

51
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:37,223
And then we go back, we have s, e and a.
And, we find a value, so we go ahead and

52
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:41,789
put out the a.
Now we drop the a and do the l, and that's

53
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:48,098
the l, l, l, l,. and then we get to that
s, we have a value we can put ourselves.

54
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:53,146
And then we can drop these, get back to
the s, and get the sh.

55
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:57,773
She, finite value, and put, put the she in
the queue.

56
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:04,923
Lls and put shells on the queue.
Drop all those values down to the h, and

57
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:10,055
get us sho, shor, shore,
Find the value and drop shore onto the

58
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:14,900
queue.
And then finally, t, th, the and, find a

59
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,392
value and put the, down the queue.
So it's easy to, very easy to keep track

60
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:30,759
of the sequence of characters on the path
from the rout to every node and every node

61
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,448
check for value and programmer key.
That's a ordered iteration and

62
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:41,559
implementations of these extra operations
are just based on multiplying ordered

63
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:46,346
iteration.
So this is a implementation of keys with,

64
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:54,064
which is essentially of the operation that
I was tracing on the last slide.

65
00:05:54,324 --> 00:06:01,349
So if client wants keys, we make a queue.
Then we call a recursive routine that

66
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:06,310
collects all the keys in the try, starting
at that node.

67
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:13,171
And, given a null string, which is, the,
sequence of characters on the path to the

68
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:17,544
given node.
When that recursive routine, returns, then

69
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,350
we just return the queue.
And the recursive routine does encode what

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,647
I said in words, most of the time.
This is for a try.

71
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:33,453
You can do the same thing for a Turner
research tree with just a little more

72
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:37,863
code.
So for every character we just move down

73
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:45,330
the trie for that character add the
character to the prefix and also pass the

74
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,878
queue along.
If we get a null value, we put what we

75
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:57,431
have on the queue when we get null when we
return. So a very simple implementation of

76
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:03,736
ordered iteration of the recursive.
So that's the implementation of the keys

77
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:08,792
method.
So prefix matches an other things like

78
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:13,749
that going to work.
Are going to work, just by modifying that,

79
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:21,246
and you're familiar with, prefix matches,
When you type, nowadays, in your browser,

80
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:28,185
a search, function, you're getting, a
prefix match of all the things that you

81
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:33,688
typed or other people have typed, that,
matches those strings.

82
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:39,430
And you find that also nowadays when
searching in your address books.

83
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:47,611
It's a quite, common function nowadays.
So let's look at how that looks, in an

84
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,551
R-way trie.
So what about finding all the keys in a

85
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,255
symbol table that start with a given,
prefix.

86
00:07:55,255 --> 00:08:01,875
Well, we just search for that prefix.
And then, then just do a collect at the

87
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:06,210
keys in that sub tri.
So that's, very straightforward.

88
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:12,628
So you get the node.
That is the one you get to by starting

89
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:18,306
with that prefix and then you just call
the recursive collect and boom you're

90
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:22,755
done.
Extremely simple, implementation of keys

91
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:27,995
with a prefix in an R-way trie..
What about longest prefix?

92
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:35,100
And here's one that, is, is, very,
actually very heavily used, in the

93
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,418
internet.
If your query strings are IP addresses on

94
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:48,451
the internet and you have some given
destination IP address, the router has a

95
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:56,383
lot of IP addresses in a routing table.
An it wants to choose the one that will

96
00:08:56,383 --> 00:09:00,723
get you as far as close to the destination
as you can.

97
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,847
So it's going to choose the longest
prefix.

98
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:09,731
So if you want to get to 128 by 112, you
can think of these as hops on the way to

99
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:14,090
where you want to get, where eleven is the
final destination.

100
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,120
And essentially this table says, it knows
how to get this far and so that's what it

101
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,133
wants is the longest prefix.
The longest prefix matches this one. Well,

102
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:30,872
it doesn't know how to get any further
than 112 and this other one only to 128.

103
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:38,120
I, and this operation gets performed
extremely often on the internet nowadays.

104
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,803
Just a quick note,
It's not the same as the floor function

105
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:46,680
and it actually is a kind of a string
operation.

106
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:51,910
These things actually, usually on the
internet, they're not represented as

107
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:55,283
strings.
They're represented as binary numbers.

108
00:09:55,489 --> 00:10:00,514
But in machine or assembly language
implementation tries are even easier.

109
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:06,364
You can just take a bunch of bits and use
them as index into a table to move down

110
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:09,805
the try.
And actually tries are pretty old because

111
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:14,829
so easy to implement data structures in
that way in the past.

112
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:20,473
You'd be surprised at how much of our
computational infrastructure is built by

113
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,525
Program or consists of programs that are
written in machine or assembly language

114
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:30,191
that can make use, efficient, really
efficient use of low level representations

115
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:33,874
like this.
But it's also useful in higher-level

116
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:37,883
languages.
So what does it look like in an R-way

117
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:41,585
trie..
Well, all we're going to do is just do a

118
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:48,062
search and then we're going to keep track
of the longest key that we encountered.

119
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:53,597
So, we have a path.
And on that path there is the most

120
00:10:53,597 --> 00:11:03,035
recently seen value that's the longest key
that we found If we end that at no link

121
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,891
that's fine.
It's the, if there is a value on that node

122
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:12,825
that's kind of a no link that's the value
we're going to return.

123
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:17,218
So that's a very straightforward
implementation.

124
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:23,077
Just keeping track of the longest key
encountered on the search for our key.

125
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:29,706
That's implementation of longest prefix of
and the usual set up of, of making

126
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:34,940
recursive calls.
And this code is quite straightforward.

127
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:40,719
And application of this one and so-called
T9 texting.

128
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:48,135
And now you know, when we do a course like
this, we try to keep up with modern

129
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:53,240
technology.
And modern technology is moving almost as

130
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,019
fast as we can.
There are lots of young people who really

131
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,353
don't know about texting with keypads
anymore.

132
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:10,762
But there's a certain range of, you know,
five or ten years where people got

133
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:17,103
extremely adept at doing so called
multi-tap input, where the only keys on

134
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,669
the phone were the nine keys to dial
numbers.

135
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:26,058
And then you had three letters associated
with each number,

136
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:32,240
Like on old dial telephones.
And to enter a letter you had to like to

137
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,581
enter an H you had to tap twice, cuz
that's the second letter on the four key

138
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:42,464
you had to tap four twice or something
like that.

139
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:47,237
So,
The so-called T9 text input would use the

140
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:55,525
kinds of algorithms that we're talking
about to make it so that maybe you didn't

141
00:12:55,525 --> 00:13:01,869
have to do multi-tap.
So rather than type two 4's, you would do

142
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:07,803
a tries type search to figure out which
word that you typed.

143
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:13,235
And that now looked,
It'll look good to us as a potential

144
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:19,184
application for a while.
Glad we didn't spend too much time on it.

145
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,942
If you study this keyboard, maybe you'll
see, see why.

146
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:31,446
Well you think about how to implement it.
But once we get into it, we realize, Kevin

147
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:38,695
realized there's no S in this sample
keypad, what happened to the S?

148
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:47,226
So what are we going to implement because
even if there's no S there, so what

149
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:56,311
exactly are they doing and well maybe this
is a bit of a fantasy that this is the

150
00:13:56,311 --> 00:14:03,180
response that, maybe these people lived in
a world with no S's.

151
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,260
Mmm.
Well anyway, we've moved on from tries

152
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,609
from, from that type of, way of entering

153
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:19,736
But I still want to mention a few more
ideas because the basis behind tries and

154
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:26,605
Turner research trees is still out there
and is still really an important part of

155
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:31,757
our infrastructure.
And there's some really great algorithms

156
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:38,426
that we just don't have time to cover.
Now one of them's an old algorithm called

157
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:43,119
Patricia.
And, This one, is a really interesting and

158
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,964
intricate algorithm.
Particularly when implemented for binary

159
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:53,944
tries, where you just do a bit at a time.
And people, again, implemented this kind

160
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:59,924
of algorithm in machine language.
And got extremely efficient performance.

161
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:07,176
If we cast it in, in, our way tries that
we've talked about it's really the best

162
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:11,635
way to think about it is, a way to remove
one way branching.

163
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:16,958
It seems wasteful, to have, all these
nodes that just have one branch.

164
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,496
And so one of the main ideas behind
Patricia there's others that, don't

165
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:27,891
really, show up, in the level, high level
representation we're using.

166
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:35,258
But one of the main ideas behind Patricia
was rather than associate a character with

167
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:39,231
each node,
Associated sequence of characters with

168
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:43,718
each node, so you just don't have any one
way branching.

169
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:51,876
Implementing this is maybe one step beyond
this course but maybe it's within what we

170
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:57,914
could do in this course.
Where just not going to take the time to

171
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:02,401
do so.
And you'll find implementations that in

172
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:08,996
practice avoid the one-way branching that
are used in many, many applications,

173
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:14,824
performance critical applications for
searching nowadays, I already mentioned IP

174
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:19,177
routing tables.
There's probably, you know, no piece of

175
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:22,617
code that's executed more often than that
one.

176
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:28,726
That's based on a trie type algorithm.
And we have these other applications

177
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:33,560
listed as well.
It's got some other names too.

178
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:42,325
Another thing, is, so called, suffix tree.
So, that's, building a tree from a suffix

179
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:46,883
table.
So, we talked about having, for suffix

180
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:53,982
sorting, we talk about applications.
You can also build a search structure from

181
00:16:53,982 --> 00:17:00,469
suffixes of a string.
That admits, all kinds of, fast string

182
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:07,707
processing application.
And again, usually, eliminate on way

183
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:14,574
branching in suffix trees, and also
amazing, amazingly you can get'em

184
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:20,352
constructed in linear time.
And there's all kinds of interesting

185
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:26,986
applications of suffix trees probably the
most important now a days are in

186
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:33,255
computation biology databases.
Again extensions of the kinds of

187
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:40,336
algorithms that we've talked about today.
So I think the bottom line for considering

188
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:46,350
string search trees is that it's a real
success story in algorithm design and

189
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,590
analysis.
It's a number of clever algorithms that

190
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:57,991
really have made a difference in the kinds
of operations that we can perform in the

191
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:03,080
amount of data that we can handle in
modern applications.

192
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,654
We, we started with red-black BST's which
is a pretty good solution for a general

193
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:16,820
symbol table.
And also hash tables, which are also

194
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,426
widely used.
But with tries, and Turner research tries

195
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:30,560
we have a performance guarantee where
we'll only have to really access log-in

196
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,532
characters.
And when you think about that, that's,

197
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:41,271
even when N is huge, that's going to be a
pretty small number.

198
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:49,172
Say we're looking among billions, billions
of things log in, even in you only have

199
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:55,851
two wave branching would be 30.
And when we have 256 way branching, it's

200
00:18:55,851 --> 00:19:01,307
way, way smaller.
And that's just the number of, so it's the

201
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:06,905
number of characters accessed.
And the, really the bottom line is, if

202
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:12,595
you, you can set things up nowadays even
on the internet when there's huge, huge

203
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:18,146
amounts of data out there you can set
things up so that you can only need to

204
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:24,530
look at maybe 100 bits to get at anything.
We think about 100 bits, that's specifies

205
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,734
two to the 100th of possibilities.
And two to the 100th is a huge number.

206
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:35,423
There are not two to the 100th pieces of
information, even on the internet, even

207
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:39,568
will ever exist on the internet in the.
Into this galaxy.

208
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:46,166
But with just 100 bits, which really isn't
too much, we can search for anything

209
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,566
efficiently.
And that's an amazing success story for

210
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:56,488
algorithm design and analysis.
So that completes our look at tries and

211
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,180
Turner research tries.
