.finally Finally we're going to look at
suffix arrays and string processing using
this data structure that has really played
a very important role in, string
processing applications that would not
otherwise be possible.
To get a feeling for the idea, we're going
to look at a really old idea that you're
actually familiar with called keyword in
context search.
And the idea is that you're given a text,
a huge X and what you want to do is
pre-process it to enable fast substring
search.
That is, you want a client to be able to
give a query string and then you want to
give all occurrences of that query string
in context.
So, if you look for the word, search, it
will give all the occurrences of where the
word search occurs in context.
Or better thing is another one.
And that's a, a very common operation.
One, you're certainly familiar with it
from web searching, in your browser.
And there's many other applications.
This is a pretty old idea that dates back
to the late 50's, early 60's people have
always wanted to do this.
And there's an easy way to look at it
called suffix sorting.
The idea is you take your input string,
and then, form the suffixes. remember when
I talked about at the beginning with
JAVA's string data type, you can get this
done in linear time because each suffix is
basically a pointer back into the input
string.
So the suffix, remember, the I suffix just
start the character I and take the rest of
the string.
So, what this does is, it gives, sort
keys, that, contain, kind of the, the,
Pieces of the string itself in context and
all we do is just, run a sort on that
suffix.
And what that sort does is, it brings if
you do a search, it brings the things that
you're searching for, close together.
And, you can use, once you've done that
suffix sort, you can use a binary search
to find all occurrences of the string out
of there.
That's the, basic idea of a keyword and
context searching.
You suffix sort the text, then do binary
search to find the query that you're
looking for.
And then you can, scan for wherever the
binary search ends up.
And so, this is all the places where, the
word search occurs, in the text of Tale of
Two Cities,
And then, you can use this index, to,
print out the context of whatever's
needed.
It's a fine and effective way, for solving
this important practical problem.
And that's interesting, but I want to talk
about another really important problem
that, it has, hugely important
applications. This is the longest repeated
substring problem.
So you're given a string of characters,
find the longest repeated substring. in
this case, this is genomic data, and,
there's the example of the longest,
repeated substring. And now, in scientific
data, the long repeated substring is often
something that scientists are looking for.
And so, and these strings are, are huge.
it might be billions of these, characters.
And so, it's really important, not only to
know that you can find long substrings
efficiently, but also, that you can do it
for, huge, huge strings.
Another example is, cryptanalysis.
Where, a long repeat in a file that's
supposed to be, encrypted random file
indicates that somebody did something
wrong.
It might be the key to, breaking the code.
Another example is data compression.
When you've got a file that's got a lot of
repeated stuff in it, you might, want to
do this operation, to take advantage of,
of these long repeats and not keep
multiple copies of them.
Here's another example, this for, studying
or visualizing repetitions in music.
In this example, every time there's a, a
repeat of the notes then, there's, a, an
arch drawn to, visualize the repeat.
And it's, the arch is thick if, the number
of repeats is long.
And it's high if the repeats are far away.
And this, tells, is an interesting way to
analyze, repetitions, in music.
So, how are we going to solve this
problem?
Very simple to state problem.
Given a sequence of N characters, find the
longest repeated substring.
As with many problems, there's, an easy,
brute force algorithm, that, at least
gives us an idea of what, what the
computation is like.
But it's not going to be useful for huge
strings.
And that's you try all possibilities, all
pairs of indices I and J and then just
compute the longest common prefix for each
pair.
The problem with that is that if N is the
length of the string, you've got, N
squared over two pairs.
And for every one of those pairs, you
might have to, match them up to length D.
It's definitely quadratic time, more than
quadratic time in the length of the
string.
And can't be using that for, you're not
going to be able to use that for strings
that are billions of characters long.
Another way to look at one way to solve
the longest repeated substring, is to use
a suffix sort. In fact, just we talked
about before.
So, I would take out our input string.
Reform the suffixes.
And then sort the suffixes and that brings
the long repeated substrings together.
So, that's a quite elegant and efficient
solution to this problem. just build the
suffix array that's a linear time process.
Do the sort.
We, we just saw we can do that, with n log
n character, character compares.
And then go through and find the repeated
the substrings.
So, it's just one passthrough to check for
adjacent substrings to see which one's the
longest.
And this is very easy to code up.
Here's the Java code for computing the
longest repeated substring.
We get the length of our string out.
We build our suffix array.
Remember that's linear time and space
because of Java string implementation
allows us to do substring and constant
time.
Then we go ahead and sort the suffixes,
and then find the least common prefix
between the, adjacent suffixes in sorted
order.
Just keep track of the max so that's
longest, repeated substring.
And if so, for example, this sentence
about such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty,
joky, hoky-pokie, lad, is the longest
repeated substring in the text of
Melville's Moby Dick.
And now we run that one to, prove that
we've got a linear-rhythmic algorithm
because there's a lot of characters in
that.
And you're not going to find this, without
a good algorithm.
And, and this is just a humorous approach
to what we've, talked about today.
If you have, five scientists that are
looking for a long substring, in a genome,
that, they might encounter, this problem,
with a billion nucleotides, and there are
plenty of scientists that are not aware
of, important algorithms are the ones,
like the ones that we are talking about.
And the one that uses the good algorithm
is definitely more likely to find a cure
for cancer.
But there is a flaw even in this, that
computer scientists discovered as they got
into ever more complex algorithms for
problems like this, and that is if the,
the longest repeated substring is long,
there's a problem.
So this is just some, experiments, for,
finding the longest, repeated substring in
various files.
From just a program to, the text of Moby
Dick.
Or a chromosome with 7.1 million
characters.
And, using, the, brute force method, you
get stuck, and too slow, very soon.
But using, a suffix sort, you can get
these jobs done, even for huge files like
the first ten million digits of pi.
By the way, if there was a really long
repeated substring in the first in the
digits of pi, that would be news.
Maybe it would help us, understand more,
about this number.
So lots of people, write programs of this
sort.
But the big problem is if you have a
really long repeated substring, then
suffix sort is not going to work.
Our fast algorithm, doesn't complete.
So what's going on?
In the explanation is really simple.
If, for example, you have two copies of
something.
When you form the suffix array, what
happens is that if you have the longest
repeat, but you also have every version of
that repeat appears.
And you have to look for those when
checking, for the longest repeated
substring.
So, if D is the length longest match,
then, just to check for the longest common
prefix, you got to do, at least one + two
+ three + four up to D character compares.
Which means it's going to be quadratic
just for checking for the longest common
prefix of adjacent, elements in this
algorithm.
It's also a problem for the sort.
So, if you have very long repeats, we
still don't have an algorithm.
So, the question is, that was confronting,
computer scientists, in the late 80's,
early 90's is how can we get this done?
What's the best algorithm for this
problem?
And there was a great algorithm called the
Manber-Myers algorithm,
That I'll talk about in just a minute.
That got the job done in linear rhythmic
time.
And actually, there's a clever old
algorithm that uses the data structure
called, suffix trees.
But it was really the Manber-Myers
Algorithm that, got people, excited about
this area.
And so, I want to describe that, briefly.
Actually, these two computer scientists,
one of them went on the become chief
scientist of an internet company.
The other one went on to become chief
scientist of a company that won the race
in sequencing the genome.
In both cases, good algorithms for
processing long strings are very
important.
And this is a great algorithm.
Now, it's a little too complex to give all
the details in a lecture, but I can give a
pretty good idea of how it works.
So the overview is that, it's kind of like
an MSD, sort.
But, what it manages to do is double the
number of characters that it looks at in
each passthrough of the array.
And, the idea is that, you, since you're
doubling the number of characters that you
look at each time.
It, it finishes in, log in time that's the
size of the, suffix array.
If, if you double until you get n, it's
log n.
And it turns out, what's really ingenious
about the algorithm is that, you can do
it, do each phase in linear time.
So, this is an example of how it works.
So, it's, we going to do a suffix sort.
And then I'll, I'll talk about the least
common prefix as well in a minute.
So, sorting the first character, while we
just use key, key index counting or
something like that.
So we know how to do that, in linear time.
And then the idea has given that sorted on
the first character.
We can sort it, easily sort on the first
two.
Well again, we could use, key index
counting.
So now, what we can do is, double the
number of characters that we, involve each
time.
So, the next phase of the Manber-Myers
algorithm, now gets it sorted on four
characters.
And, of course, as we, the more characters
we have sorted on at the leading part, the
smaller the [INAUDIBLE] files in the
trading, in the trailing part. So, that's,
certainly a feature.
And then, in this case, after we get to,
eight characters, and all our sub files
are of size one, and we're done with the
sort.
Now, the key to the algorithm is, the idea
that, once it's going, it uses what's
called an index sort,
Which essentially means that it can do
compares in constant time in the middle of
the algorithm.
Now, lets just take a look at, at, at how
that works.
So lets look at, trying to compare string
zero with string, nine.
And we know that we've already got the
thing sorted on, four characters and we
want to sort it on eight So, zero and nine
are equal on the first four characters.
They're in the same subfile.
So, now we're going to get it sorted on
the other.
But the thing is if we add four to our
given indices. So, we're at zero, and we
add four.
That gets us to four, and we're at nine.
We add four that gets us to thirteen. we
already know that the thing is sorted on
those characters.
And, we know that, thirteen appears before
four in this sorted list.
It's already sorted.
And we can keep track of that by, using an
inverse array which says, for every index,
where it appears in the sorted order.
So, this says that thirteen appears at
position six, and four appears at position
seven.
That is, thirteen appears before four.
So, when we're trying to compare, the,
this, string here, that's the zeroth
suffix with the ninth suffix,
We can go in and again, add four to get
four, add four to get thirteen go into the
index array and see which one is less and
the one that appears first is going to be
less.
So, that's a constant time, comparison.
Thirteen is less than or equal to four
because the inverse of thirteen is less
than the inverse four, which means that
suffixes of nine, if you take eight
characters out of nine and eight
characters out of zero, it's less.
It's a really, simple and of course,
Easy to implement operation.
So, maintaining the inverse, I can get
constant time string compare.
So, what does that imply, for the whole
suffixsort??uh
Well,
With a constant time compare, then, I can
get, at a minimum, I can get an, an analog
N sort, just by using quicksort or
mergesort.
And then, I get much faster than quadratic
performance no matter what the strings
are.
That's a big key to the success of this
algorithm.
And actually, if, if you use a version of
three-way quicksort, it's been proven that
it even gets down to linear time for the
sort,
No matter what the input is.
That's one thing, and then the other thing
is when you need to do, the longest common
prefix to look for the, longest match
after the array is sorted you can also do
this constant time, string compare and get
the job done.
So this is really an in-, ingenious
algorithm that, can get, suffix sorting
done very fast. even in the presence of, a
huge repeat.
And I think really underscores, the
importance of careful algorithmic
thinking, in addressing new computational
challenges.
So, string sorting, just to summarize, is
a really, interesting area of inquiry.
For one thing, we can develop linear time
sorts for many, many applications.
We, we thought, we're doing well when we
had, n log n sorts, but actually we can do
much better for many applications.
And in fact, we can even get to sublinear
where we don't even have to examine all
the data.
In today's world, when we have huge
amounts of data, to be able to, get it
sorted without even looking, at it at all
is really quite a miracle.
Three-way string quicksort,,you you can't
do better than that in terms of the
numbers of characters that you have to,
examine.
And it's a lot of deep mathematical
analysis, behind that result.
But I think the other lesson to learn is
that algorithms like three-way string
quicksort and Manber-Myers, show that we
really have a lot to learn still in string
processing.
And they're not really random.
In fact, a lot of times we're looking for
non-randomness and we might want to use
specialized algorithms.
So, at string processes or introduction to
string processing,
We're going to look at many other string
processing examples in the coming
lectures.
