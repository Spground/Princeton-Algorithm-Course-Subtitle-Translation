Now, we'll look at topological sorting.
A digraph processing application that
doesn't quite have a parallel with
undirected graphs.
And it's a very general model that is, is
very widely, widely used and here's the
simplest example of it called, precedence
scheduling.
So the idea is that you've got a set of
tasks that need to be completed,
But there's precedence constraints, and
you want to know in what order should you
schedule the tasks. so, you might think
that this is like courses in a university
curriculum.
For, so is the model we'll us the vertices
will be the task and the edges will be the
precedence constraint.
And all these says is there's an edge from
three to six, that means you have to take
introduction to Computer Science before
you take Advance Programming.
And so there's so, all of these source of
constraints in a graph. and so what you
want is, A what's called a feasible
schedule,
So that's just an order in which you can
take the linear order, in which you can
take the courses one after the other that
respects the precedence.
So, that corresponds to drawing the graph,
such that all the edges point upwards.
And this model is used to study
manufacturing processes and many other
applications.
So, that's the topological sorting
problem.
So, first thing is topological sort works
on a DAG, so called DAG.
That's a digraph that has no cycles.
If you have a cycle there's no way you're
going to be able to solve the problem.
In fact we'll, simpler hraph processing
problem is just find out if a graph has a
cycle.
And we'll talk about that in a second,
But let's do topological sort first.
So we know that the graph has no cycles.
It's a directed, acyclic graph, graph,
And what we want to do is, find a way to
redraw the DAG, so that all the edges
point upwards,
Yh, or give, a bottom to top order so that
all the edges are pointing upward.
That's called a topological order of the
graph.
And, that'll give, in this case, an order
in which maybe you could take the courses
or perform the manufacturing process or
whatever else.
So, that's the problem.
So how are we going to solve it?
Well, we're going to use DFS.
In fact, one of the lessons for
particularly for digraph processing is DFS
is going to provide a way to solve it.
It might be hard to find a different way.
So let's look at a demo of topological
sort.
And all of this is just run DFS, but there
is a particular point in which we, we want
to take the vertices out to get the order,
and that's called reverse DFS post-order.
So, lets look at how that works.
What we do is, when we do the DFS, when we
are done with the vertex we put it on a
stack or put it out,
So, lets look at how that works.
So,
We had just run DFS the same as before,
But we're not keeping track of anything,
except the vertices that we're done with.
So, visit, visit, vertex zero.
We have to check the places that you can
get to it from zero.
It's one, two, and five.
So we check one, one is unmarked, so we're
going to mark it and recursively visit
one.
So we do that and we have to check four
and four again is unmarked, so we recurse.
But now both of the edges to four are in,
so there's nowhere to go from four, so
we're done with four.
When we're done with four, we output it,
actually put it on a stack.
So that's order, the order in which we're
done with the vertices.
That's called postorder.
So now, once we're done with four, now
we're done with one, there's no where else
to go so we put it on the post order.
And now, we're back at zero and we have to
check the other vertices that we get to
from zero.
So, here's two and get two from two, and,
it's unmarked, so we visit it.
But there's no place to go,
So we're done with it.
So we put it on the postorder and go back
to zero.
Then we go to five, unmarked, so we visit
it.
Then we check two, which is marked, so
nothing to do.
And then we're done with five.
And, once we're done with five, then we're
done with zero.
And that's the postorder of the vertices
that you can get to it from zero.
So now we have to check all the other
vertices in the graph,
But we have to find some other place, and
so we just check the vertices in order.
Next one that we find that's unmarked is
three.
And so to visit three, we have to check,
two, four, five, and six.
And two, four, and five, are all marked,
So nothing to do.
Six is unmarked,
So we go visit six.
When we visit six, zero and four are,
already, marked, so there's nothing to do.
Then we're done with six, And finally,
we're done with three.
And we're done with the vertex.
We'd put it out. That's or if we put it on
a stack, and then we get reverse postorder
and that turns out is the answer that we
need.
So the code is pretty simple but we'll
have to look a little more carefully to be
convinced that it works.
So it's depth-first search but we have
additional data structure, which is a
stack of integers, which is the vertices
and reverse postorder.
The constructor just creates that stack,
And then the only thing we change to DFS
is when we're done with the vertex, before
exiting, we put that vertex on the reverse
post stack. and then the client simply
gets the stack returned, that's
inevitable.
And iterating through that will give the
vertices in the reverse DFS postorder
which is the order you which is the
topologically sorted order.
It's a very simple and compelling use of
DFS.
Actually this is an amazingly simple
algorithm, but it went undiscovered for
many years.
People were using much more complicated
algorithms for this problem.
Okay.
So, reverse DFS postorder of a DAG is the
topological order.
That's, the correctness proof, that we
have to consider.
This diagram over here, is a record of the
recursive calls, for that example that we
just did.
To visit zero, we probably visit one, and
then we visit four.
And then we're done with four, and then
we're done with one.
And then we visit two, down with two, Then
do five, which checks two, And five down
and so forth.
So this gives a record of the calls, just,
For reference in this proof for that
example.
Alright. So now, we want to consider any
edge where v points to w and we want to
consider the point where dfs of V is
called.
And there's a bunch of cases.
So one case is that dfs w, has already
been called and returned.
So in this example, when v equals three, w
equals two, four, or five, they were
already done.
So, if we put out, those vertex numbers,
before we put, three out, then the arrow
from v to w is going to point up.
They were already done.
So that's case one. That's an easy case.
Case two, they're all easy cases.
[laugh] Case two is, dfs w hasn't, been
called yet, but if there's an edge from v
to w we're going call it and then recurse,
it's going to finish before we're done
with three.
So again, the edge from v to w is going to
point out, three to six.
And the only other possible case might be
that, dfs w is already been called but not
returned.
But that can't happen,
In, because there's no cycles.
If d, dfs w had been called but not yet
returned,
Then the function call stack is going to,
from it's, it's going to have path from w
to v on it.
And so. if we have an edge v-w, that would
give a cycle, but there is no cycles.
So from those observations we know that
all vertices pointing from three are done
before three is done,
So they appear after three in the
topological order, or they point up if we
put the vertices in reverse topological
order.
So that's the correctness proof for
topological order.
So, a similar, process, is, to detect a
cycle.
A topological sort doesn't work if a
graph's got a cycle,
So one of the things we might want to do
is, just, find cycles in digraphs.
Now, if you're a college and you put out a
curriculum that's got a directed cycle,
you have your problem so you might want to
process that first.
So,
If there's a directed cycle, you can't
have a topological order.
If there's no directed cycle then we've
just found it.
So, one thing you might want, is given a
digraph, find a directed cycle.
And how are you going to do that?
You're going to use DFS and that's a
simple algorithm that you might want to
think about and,
It's in a few lines in the book.
So, precedence scheduling is a, an
excellent example of the use of search
directed graph,
And, this is the cycle of length one.
Of course, that requires itself as a
prerequisite.
And, this is just an example of a very
widely computation.
And it really has many, many applications.
So for example, the Java compiler actually
does cycle con, detection.
If you have a class A extends B, and
another one B extends C, and another one C
extends A,
That's going to create a problem.
Class hierarchies are not supposed to have
cycles,
And it'll actually, the Java compiler will
actually give a, an error message saying
there's cyclic inheritance.
You're not allowed to do that.
So there's many applications that involve
essentially digraphs that aren't supposed
to add cycles.
Another example is Microsoft Excel.
So if you do cyclic reference like this in
Excel, which in a big spreadsheet, now you
can imagine might .. that's, that's an
error,
And not only this Microsoft Excel flag the
error.
It says you have, created a circular
reference, try one of the following,
And it's actually got a circular reference
toolbar, that will help you figure out,
what to do, in that case.
So, cycle detection and topological
sorting are important applications in
depth-first and digraphs.
