To introduce the algorithms for minimum
spanning tree, we're going tp look at a
general algorithm called a greedy
algorithm.
It's a good example of a general principle
in algorithm design that will help us,
prove correctness of our algorithms.
To begin we'll make some simplifying
assumptions.
First we assume that the edge weights are
all distinct, and that the graph is
connected.
And this is just to simplify the
presentation.
As a consequence of these two exhumptions
we know that the minimum spanning tree
exists and is unique.
Our algorithms will still work when edge
winks are not distinct.
And if the graph is not connected, it'll
find spanning trees or components.
But these two assumptions simplify the
presentation.
Now, to understand our algorithms we're
going to start with a general operation on
graph called making a cut.
So a cut in a graph is a partition of its
vertices into two non-empty sets,
And we'll indicate that just by coloring
some of the vertices grey and others
white.
So that's a partition of the two sets: the
grey vertices and the white vertices.
Every vertex is either grey or white,
And there's at least one in each set.
Now, given a cut, the crossing edge
connects a vertex in one set with a vertex
in the other. So every edge that connects
a grey vertex to a white vertex is a
crossing edge.
So that's, a second definition.
That gives us a way to talk about, inches
and graphs when we compete them into a
spanning tree.
So an important property that is relevant
to MST algorithms is that, given any cut
at all,
The cut defines a set of crossing edges.
The minimum weight crossing edge is in the
MST. Remember no two edges have the same
weight so there's a single edge that has
minimum weight from the edges in the edges
in the cut.
So in this case the thick red edge is the
minimum weight, it's the shortest edge
connecting a grey vertex to the white one
and that, that edge has to be in the MST.
That's the cut property.
So here's a, just a quick proof of that
property.
I'll hand wave a bit through the
discussions of the proof.
It's a.
Usually not appropriate to fully dimension
proofs in the lectures.
So you should look at the book and the
underlined materials to be sure that you
understand the proofs or, or re-read these
slides.
But I'll try to give all the steps.
So, we're trying to prove the cut
property.
Giving any cut the crossing edge in many
ways to MST.
So let's suppose the contradiction.
So suppose that we have a minimum-weight
crossing edge that's not in the MST.
So, in this case, that edge E, suppose
it's not in the MST.
So it means that some, one of the other
crossing edges has to be in the MST.
Otherwise the MST wouldn't be connected.
Then if you add E to the MST you get a
cycle.
And some other edge in that cycle has to
be a crossing edge.
That's the way to think about it.
Remember MST is a minimal way to connect
the graph.
And if you add an edge to a, a tree you
get a cycle.
And then some other edge that has to be a
crossing edge.
But if you remove that edge and add e then
you're going to get a spanning tree.
And that spanning tree is smaller than the
one that you had.
So, that, supposition had to be a
contradiction.
So, it has to be that the minimum weight
crossing edge is in the MST.
So that's the, cut property.
So, and now given that property, we can
develop what's called a greedy algorithm,
Which is the easiest algorithm, we can
come up with.
So what we're going to do is start with,
all edges colored grey.
Find any cut that has no black crossing
edges.
The algorithm's going to color some of the
edges black.
And color the minimum-weight edge of that
cut black, and just repeat the algorithm.
Finding any cut with no black crossing
edges, color the minimum-weight edge
black, and keep going until you have v
minus one edges that are colored back.
And the claim is that that's going to
compute an MST.
Let's look at a demo of that, just to make
sure that we follow what's going on.
So we start with all edges colored gray.
We're supposed to find a cut with no black
crossing edges and colors minimum weight
edge black.
Well, that could be any cut.
In this case, we'll take the cut that, has
three, two, and six on one side and, one,
zero, zero, one, four, five, seven on the
other side.
Look at all the crossing edges.
Minimum white crossing edge is the one
from zero to two, so the, that's the one
that we'll color black.
So now we have zero, two and the MST is
color black.
So again, any cut that doesn't have a
black crossing edge, so in this case,
let's do the cut that just has five on one
side and all the odds on the other side.
In this case, there's three crossing
edges, the smallest one is five, seven,
color that one black.
Again, any cut that has no black crossing
edges.
So let's just take six the cut that has
six on one side and all the others and the
other.
Two, six is the minimum crossing edge so
six, two.
And so we put that one on the MST.
As we get more and more black edges it's
going to be harder to find a cut with no
black crossing edges.
But we press on.
So now let's do the cut with zero, two,
four, and six on one side colored white.
And one, three, five, and seven on the
others.
So there's a lot of crossing edges that
cut.
But the smallest one is the one between
zero and seven, so that's the one that we
color black and add to the MST.
So now we have four edges, and our next
cut now one and three on one side.
A smallest edge in that, right, the
smallest crossing edge for that cut is
two, three.
Now one more, now let's put one and four,
now almost all the edges left are crossing
edges.
So one and four are one side, all the rest
are in the other.
And, the minimum weight crossing edge is
the one from one to seven.
Now notice, in this case, we got the nodes
in the tree on one side of the kit, cut.
And the nodes not in the tree on the other
side of the cut.
One of our algorithms will always have
that property.
So now, we add one to seven.
Seven in seven to that,
And now the last thing, is to.
The only cut that, has no black edges is
the one that puts four on one side, and
all the rest on the other.
And the minimum way of crossing edge for
that one is, five, four.
So now, we've got. eight vertices,
And seven vertices in the seven edges in
the MST. so we found the MST.
We've got V minus one edge is color black
and we found the MST.
So the greedy algorithm was a very general
algorithm.
We're allow to find any cut at all that
has no black cras crossing edges.
So let's do the correctness proof.
And then we'll look at some specific
instances of the greedy algorithm.
So.
First of all since we took the minimum
crossing edge of a cut always to color
black any black edge is in the MST.
That's the cut property.
Do a cut no black crossing edges you can
color black, that's in the MST.
So that's first observation.
Now when we have.
Fewer than v minus one black edges.
There has to be a cut that has no black
crossing edges.
That is the algorithm doesn't get stuck.
And so the way to think about that is just
take the verticies in one of the connected
components, and make that the cut.
Then there's gonna be, since that's a
connected component there's gonna be no
black edges in the crossing edges for, for
that cut.
So the algorithm doesn't get stuck.
If the, if you don't have an MST yet,
there's going to be some cut with no black
crossing edges.
And that's it.
The greedy algorithm computes the MST.
Any edge colored black is in the MST,
And you can always add to the set of black
edges.
Now if you don't have v minus one once you
have v minus one you've got v minus one
edges that are in the MST. The MST has v
minus one edges greedy algorithm computes
mst.
So now what we want to do is
implementations of the greedy algorithm
or, or specializations of it really that
differ first of all in the way that they
choose the cut.
Which cut are we going to use?
And also, the way in which they find the
minimum weight edge in the cut.
Again, those could both be, expensive
operations.
And prohibitively, prohibitively expense,
expensive for huge graphs.
What we're going to look at is, two
classic implementations called Kruskal's
Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm.
Although, in both cases, we use modern
data structures to make them efficient for
huge graphs.
And there's another interesting algorithm
called Boruvka's Algorithm, that, that
kind of combines the two briefly
mentioned.
Now before getting to those, what about
removing the two simplifying assumptions?
So what happens if you have, a situation
where the edge weights are not all
distinct?
So in this, case, 1-2 and 2-4.
Both have the same edge weight.
Well so also do one three and three four.
And so it means there's multiple MSTs.
So in this case the, there's two different
MSTs.
So the greedy algorithm is still correct,
it turns out, our correctness proof
doesn't quite work, but that can be fixed
with a little bit of work.
So the fact is it's still correct.
And if the graph is not connected, as I
mentioned, then what we'll get is what's
called a minimum spanning forest, which is
the MST of each component.
Essentially it's like independently
computing the MSTs of the components.
But.
Basically what the greedy algorithm gives
us is an easy way to prove correctness for
specific algorithms.
All we have to show is that they're
finding a cut and taking a minimum weight
edge from that cut.
And then we can prove correctness of a
more complicated algorithm.
In general, in algorithm design this is
proven to be affective in all kinds of
domains.
Trying to come up with a general algorithm
that you can prove works efficiently and
then using that to help design specific
ones.
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that
greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
Greed is right.
Greed works.
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
Greed in all of it's forms.
Greed for life, for money, for love,
knowledge, has marked the upward surge of
mankind.
And greed, you mark my words, will not
only save Teldar Paper,
But that other malfunctioning corporation
called the USA.
Thank you very much.

Great, great.
Fly me to the moon, and let me play among
the stars. .
