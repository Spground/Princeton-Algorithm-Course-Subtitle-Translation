Today we're gonna finish off our
discussion of graph processing by looking
at Max Flow algorithms.
This is another general problem solving
model for which we have efficient
algorithms, so where at the difference
between having a good algorithm and not
having one makes a difference between
being able to solve all kinds of practical
problems and not being able to address
them at all.
As an introduction we'll take a look at
what the problem is and some of it's
implications.
So first we'll start with what's called
the mincut problem.
So this is a. takes as input a Edge
Weighted Digraph and now we are going to
assume that the edge weights are positive,
and we referred to the weight as a
capacity and you will see why in just a
minute.
And also we specify a source and a target
vertex.
This is not an absolute requirement but it
will simplify our discussion for the
lecture.
So we have an edge weighted digraph where
the source and target vertex and every
edge has a positive capacity.
Now a cut, an ST cut, S and T are
specified remember? Is the partition of
the vertices into two disjoint sets,
Where s is one set and t is in the other.
And we'll indicate a cut as we've done
before by coloring the vertices in one
set.
So in this case, the cut consists of s in
one set, and all the other vertices in the
other.
So s is in, one set and t is in the other,
that's an st cut.
Now given a cut.
We talk about the capacity of the cut.
And that's gonna be the sum of the
capacity of the edges that go from the set
containing s to the set containing b If
you have edge going the other way we don't
count it.
So in this case, the, this cut with the
vertex containing just s in one set has
capacity 30 ten + five +fifteen.
Here's another cut this one contains three
vertices,
S and two at the bottom there.
Again it's an ST cut, cause s is colored t
is not.
And then we can look at the capacity of
that cut.
Again, we count the vertic, the edges that
go from to the cut containing s to the cup
containing b, B.
In this case, is ten + eight + sixteen
That's the edges going out is 34.
That's the capacity.
We don't count the edges that go in from
the sec containing t to the sec containing
s Capacity of the cut is the sum of the
capacities of the edges going out.
Here's the third example, and this one's
got capacity 28.
Now the three cuts that we've seen you
notice have different capacities: 30, 34,
28.
So the mincut problem, clearly, is to find
the minimum capacity cut.
Find a way to divide the vertices into two
sets, one containing s and the other
containing t with the property that the
capacity of the cut is minimized.
That's the mincut problem.
And this an important practical problem
with all kinds of applications.
Just for fun we take an application from
the 1950's.
This is around time these sorts of
problems were first articulated.
So this is, has to do with the cold war
and these are rail networks that connects
the Soviet Union with countries in Eastern
Europe.
This map actually wasn't declassified
until 1999.
But it shows a graph with the vertices,
directed graph with vertices corresponding
to cities and edges corresponding to rail
lines.
And if you look closely, you can see that,
Each of the edges is labeled with a
capacity.
The goal.
So the goal of the free world say if there
was gonna be a real war was to find a way
to cut the Soviet Union from Eastern
Europe.
And they wanna do that.
You can assume maybe the cost of cutting a
rail line is proportional to its capacity.
So they wanna find the cheapest way to cut
off supplies.
From Soviet Union, Eastern Europe.
That's an example of a min cut
application.
We'll look at some other applications
later on.
Well, look at a future, well maybe this is
a cut for today's world.
So now you have a huge graph, maybe a
social network.
And maybe there's a government and power
in some area of the world, and the goal of
that government would be to cut off the
communication to some set of people.
And again, they want to do that in the
cheapest way possible.
Find the minimum way to cut off
communication.
And certainly, people are writing programs
to process graphs like this with such
goals in mind nowadays.
These are huge, huge graphs and certainly
are going to need efficient algorithms.
In the 1950s, the graphs were pretty huge
by 1950s standards.
And it wanted efficient algorithms then
too, for sure, 'cause computers were
slower.
Alright, that's one problem.
So let's talk about a different problem,
called the max-flow problem.
And it's the same setup inputs and edge
weighted digraphs, source for text s, and
a target for text t, every edge has a
positive capacity.
And now what we're gonna talk about is
what's called a flow.
It's a assignment of values to the edges.
So, we have the capacities, and we're
gonna assign another integer to each edge,
called its flow.
And then flow has to satisfy two
properties.
The first one is that the flows have to be
positive and they can't be greater than
the capacity.
You can think of the, edges again as a
rail line containing some commodity or a
pipe containing some fluid.
So the flow is how much stuff can you put
through that edge?
You can more than zero but you can't put
more than capacity.
The other thing about a flow is that there
has to be local equilibrium at the
vertices.
And again that's a natural constraint to
think about stuff flowing in on rail lines
to a city and you want, you want to keep
things going the local elibrium constrains
says that the stuff coming in has to equal
the stuff going out at every vertex except
for the source everything leaves from the
source.
And the target, everything goes to the
target.
And those have the source has no inflow
and the target has no outflow.
So what you want is the inflow at a
vertex, say, in this example inflow at v,
there's five coming in on this edge and
five coming in on that edge. So that's a
total of ten coming in and there has to be
just ten going out.
So that's, happens on this one edge.
And that has to be satisfied at every
vertex.
So this flow's got five coming in there
and five going out.
Ten going in there and five going out each
way and so forth.
Every vertex except S and T.
And we can even make it true for S and T
by drawing an edge from T all the way back
to S.
So that's the max flow problem, well, the,
that's the definition of a flow, and of
course the max flow problem is to assign a
value to the flow.
Well that's how much stuff you can get to
the source.
To the target.
Or equivalently, how much stuff can you
push out of the source.
And so the value is how much can you get
into the target.
There's lots of different ways to assign
flows to the network to satisfy the
capacity equilibri-, equilibrium
constraint.
Which one maximizes the flow, that's the
maximum ST flow problem, or the max flow
problem.
So that's two different problems.
The min cut problem.
How do we cut the graph efficiently, with
a minimal amount of work.
And the max flow problem.
What's the maximum amount of stuff that we
can get through the graph?
And again, if we look at, the 1950's
graph.
What the Soviet Union wanted to do was
find a way to maximize the flow of
supplies to Eastern Europe.
Now that was their goal in this case, and
again you can see in this whole map, this
is a assignment of a flow to this network
that does maximize the flow for this
network,
So they figured it out.
And nowadays in the huge graph, maybe the
free world wants to do the opposite.
They want to maximize the flow of
information to some specified set of
people.
How do we get the most information in
there and is there another way to think of
it?
And again, these are huge graphs and we
want efficient algorithms.
So that's two problems both have an input
weighted digraph with a specified source
and target and then cut problem is to find
them in capacity cut and max flow problem
is find a maximum value flow.
It's a lot of computation to do for
example in the max flow problem we have to
assign a value to each edge.
So that's more work than just finding a
path as we've done in other graph
processing problems.
So it's more complicated and the amazing
thing about these two problems is that
they're actually pretty much the same
problem.
They're what we call dual.
If you solve one you're able to solve the
other.
So that's an introduction to max flow
