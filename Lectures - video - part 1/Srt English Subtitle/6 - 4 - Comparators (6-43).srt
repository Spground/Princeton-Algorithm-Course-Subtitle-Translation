1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:07,043
Next we'll take a look at comparators
which is a Java mechanism that helps us

2
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:12,034
sort. The same data on different sort
keys, different orders. And you're

3
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:18,001
familiar with this. Your music library
maybe I, at one point, you sort it by the

4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,177
artist's name. In this case we're looking
at the b's. But in another situation, you

5
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:29,190
might want to sort it by song names to
look through it by song names. That's the

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,799
same data using different sort keys. How
do we arrange to do something is natural

7
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,286
as this in our Java sorts? Now, we use the
fourth in order to be able to implement

8
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:45,839
sorts that can sort any type of data, we
use Java's Comparable interface. And that

9
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:50,578
concept is that there's some natural
ordering of the data that you'll want to

10
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:55,542
use most of the time, that's what the
Comparable interface is all about. But

11
00:00:55,542 --> 00:01:01,385
there's a different interface called the
Comparator Interface which is a way to

12
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:06,958
help a sort, using some alternate order or
many different orders on the same data.

13
00:01:07,196 --> 00:01:14,036
And the Comparator interface again just
says that it's going to implement a method

14
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:19,882
compare() that compares two different keys
of the given type, of the generic type.

15
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:25,524
Again it has to be a total order and this
is very familiar for example with strings.

16
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:30,594
There's many different ways that we might
want to sort strings. We might want to use

17
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:35,974
the natural alphabetic order or we might
want to make it case insensitive or maybe

18
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:41,034
there is just different languages that
have different rules of the ordering.

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:45,767
We're sorting strings but we're
implementing a different ordering, various

20
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:51,807
different orderings on that same data.
That's what the Comparator interface is

21
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:59,635
for. So the Java system sort will have a
different. [cough] method to implement

22
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:06,183
comparators. The idea is that you create a
comparator object and then pass that as a

23
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:12,679
second argument to Java's sort routine and
we can do the same thing for our sorts.

24
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:17,494
The idea is when a decouple, the
definition of the data type from the

25
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:22,139
definition of what it means to compare to
items of that type. With the natural

26
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:26,412
order, we had to put the definition
compared to within the data type. With

27
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:31,181
comparators, we can do that outside of the
data type even at some later time. Strings

28
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:35,642
were defined and as part of the Java
system but we can define our own ordering

29
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:42,255
on strings with the comparator. So in our
sort implementations we can change them as

30
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:47,963
shown in this example to support
comparators. To support comparators in our

31
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:53,398
sort implementations we'll pass an array
of objects and instead of an array of

32
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:58,787
comparable and then, there's a second
argument passed a comparator. Then, the

33
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:04,323
less method will take that comparator as
an argument and this is the one that

34
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:09,380
actually invokes the method compare two
different keys. This is a straightforward

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,134
modification to our sorts. And then
exchange of course rather doing comparable

36
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:18,810
has to use object. So with these
straightforward changes at the comparator

37
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,201
as argument to the sort and to less and
make array to be sorted array of objects,

38
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:29,202
it's easy to convert any of our
implementations to support comparators. To

39
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:35,969
implement a comparator you can use this
code as a model. I won't go through it all

40
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,673
in detail just to point out that this
implements two different comparators as

41
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:47,074
nested classes. Say, for this fictional
class Student, that's got two instance

42
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:53,996
variables - name and section. And the first
one called by name implements a comparator

43
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:59,671
for students and when you compare two
students by name, it's going to use the

44
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:05,749
string comparative method. If you're going
to implement it compared to students by

45
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:10,878
section, then it'll return just the
difference of the sections which is my

46
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:17,511
minus if less zero if equal then plus if
greater. And this code is straight forward

47
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:25,185
way to implement comparators that you can
use as a model. If you need to be able to

48
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:32,643
sort data on two different keys. So
[cough] here is just an example of what

49
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:38,629
happens if would those implemented
comparators for that class student using

50
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:44,890
the Java system sort, if you call array
that sort with your a rray of students and

51
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,686
you give it this by name comparator, it
will put them in order alphabetical order

52
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:56,137
by the name field. And if you give it to
by section comparator, it will them in

53
00:04:56,137 --> 00:05:02,148
order by the second field very convenient
for all kinds of data processing

54
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:07,342
applications. And we came up with that
before when we're talking about using a

55
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:13,226
sort for the Graham scan. We needed to
have a comparison for points that orders

56
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:19,020
them by the polar angle they make, make
with the given point p. That's what we

57
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,028
needed for the Graham scan algorithm for
the convex hull. Points are defined data

58
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:31,381
type for geometric objects and so what we
need is code that will compute the polar

59
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:37,269
angle and use that as the basis for
comparison. There's an easy way to do this

60
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:45,249
based on CCW that is described here in
this text. Most of the time all you need

61
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:53,308
to do is do the CCW of the two points. You
either have to check whether [cough] the,

62
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:59,167
one of the points is above p and the other
one is below. But otherwise, usually it's

63
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,001
a CCW call in this code which again I
won't go through in detail as an

64
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:10,082
implementation of a comparator for two D
points. It implements the compare method

65
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:16,085
that takes two points as argument and with
just a little bit of calculation is able

66
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:22,322
to do the compare. So this code is the
basis for applying the sort, system sort

67
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:27,048
method or any sort method for the Graham
scan for the convex hull that we did at

68
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:32,424
the end of the last lecture. So that's the
basis for the Graham scan method for the

69
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:38,025
convex hull that we used at the last, at
the end of the last lecture.
