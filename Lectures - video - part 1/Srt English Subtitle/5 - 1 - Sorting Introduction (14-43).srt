1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,616
Okay, what are the rules that we're going
to follow? Well, let's start with looking

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:10,094
at a typical basic sorting problem. Say,
university has student records and for

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:16,094
every student there is a certain amount of
information. Maybe there's a class number,

4
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:22,067
there is a grade, there's a phone number
maybe an address so we refer to an item

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:27,304
and it has a record or the information
that we're going to sort. But in

6
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:32,118
particular, there's a piece of a record
called a key and what we want to do is put

7
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:37,175
the records into order according to the
key. That's the sort problem. Re-arrange

8
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:43,204
an array of n items into ascending order
according to a defined key which is part

9
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:49,165
of the item. Now, our goal is to be able
to sort any type of data so let's look at

10
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:55,608
a couple of client programs. First example
is to just sort some random real numbers

11
00:00:55,608 --> 00:01:00,884
into ascending order. So, here's a client
that calls our insertion sort method and

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,068
all it does is read numbers from standard
input than into an array a then calls

13
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:12,515
insertion sort and then prints them out.
And you can see on the right that the

14
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:18,581
numbers are printed out in sorted order.
This seems like an artificial kind of

15
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:24,326
input but actually we'll look at an
application even in this lecture. And then

16
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:31,300
there are many applications where random
inputs are fine model. Here's maybe a more

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,934
familiar sort client that sort strings.
And in this case it reads the strings from

18
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:44,232
a file using our readStrings() method in
our In class that which takes a file as

19
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:50,186
argument. So we take the file name as the
first command line argument, read in array

20
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:56,389
of string from that file separated by
blanks, call an Insertion.sort() method again. So,

21
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:03,047
Insertion.sort is a method that takes an
array a as its parameter and it, it's the

22
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:08,817
first argument and it rearranges the
strings in that array to be in sorted

23
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:15,571
order. So in this case words, words
three.text has the certain number of three

24
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:22,014
letter words and this client program will
result in those three letter words being

25
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:27,673
rearranged into alphabetical order.
Here's another client that we could use

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:34,371
our sort program for, if we achieved the
goal of sorting any type of data. In this

27
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:41,249
one, we're going to sort file, file's name
in a given directory. So again we use the

28
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:49,508
File class from Java and we use, we go and
use the listFiles() method from that class

29
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:56,788
to get an array that contains all the file
names in the given directory. That's an

30
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:03,622
array with file names in it and Insertion.sort()
takes that array as its first

31
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:10,287
argument and again sorts them and then we
go ahead and use as, go through them one

32
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:15,754
by one and print them and they come out in
order of file name. So that's three

33
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:20,494
different clients, three completely
different types of data. And the first

34
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:25,508
rule of the game that we have to think
about is, how can we make it so that we

35
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:30,591
can implement one sort program that can be
used by these three different clients to

36
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:35,804
implement three different types of data.
In the way that, that happens is a

37
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:41,555
mechanism known as a callback. So, that's
our basic question, how can sort, now, how

38
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:46,629
to compare data of all those different
types without being given any information

39
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,692
about the type of an item's key? And the
answer is that what is we set up a

40
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:59,517
mechanism known as a callback or reference
to executable code where the client, by

41
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:05,644
passing an array of objects to the sort
function. In Java, there's an implicit

42
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:11,724
mechanism that says that any such array of
object is going to have the compareTo()

43
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:17,604
method, then the sort function calls back
the compareTo() method associated with the

44
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:22,351
objects in the array when it ever needs,
whenever it needs to compare two items.

45
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:26,645
There's a lot of different ways to
implement callbacks and that's

46
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:32,837
programming language specific. Different
languages have different mechanisms. It's

47
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:38,780
all about the idea of passing functions as
arguments to other functions which is the

48
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,206
pair and gets into functional programming
and thinking all the way back to Turing and

49
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:50,553
Church. For Java, because of the desire
to check types at compile time, the use of

50
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:56,246
specific method called an interface and
then, we'll look at the details of how to

51
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:01,040
implement callbacks with the Java
interfaces now. It's a little bit of

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,086
programming language detailed but it's,
it's really worthwhile because it allows

53
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:12,011
us to use the sorts that we developed for
any type of data in a type safe manner. So

54
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:18,084
we already looked at some clients. This is
the example of the client program that

55
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:25,001
sorts the files in a given directory by
file name. So it just calls our sort()

56
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:31,498
method with a, an array some type of
object as first argument. Now, built in to

57
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:37,939
Java is the so-called the Comparable
interface and all the Comparable interface

58
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:45,024
is the specification that a type, data
type that implements Comparable will have

59
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:52,956
a compareTo() method. And it's generic and
will be compared to against a certain type

60
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:59,902
of item. Now when we implement objects
that are to be sorted we'll implement the

61
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:06,370
Comparable method. That's up in the top
class file, implements comparable file.

62
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,351
And since sorting is an operation that's
used in so many situations, many of the

63
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:20,026
standard Java types that you would expect
to involve sorts will implement

64
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:27,040
Comparable. And all that means is that,
that data type has an instance method that

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,068
will implement the compareTo() method.
It'll compare this object against the

66
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:40,296
object given as argument and depending on
some complicated tests, it'll return -1,

67
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:46,181
meaning less, +1, meaning greater or
0, meaning equal. Now, that compareTo()

68
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:50,726
method is really all that the sort
implementation needs. First it says that,

69
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:55,833
that it's going to take as argument an
array of type Comparable. So that means,

70
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:02,023
the objects in the array are going to
implement the Comparable interface or that

71
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:08,000
it will have a compareTo() method. And then
the sort code can just use that compareTo()

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,052
method, invoked in a sense of the
object like an entry in the array and as

73
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:19,012
argument and another instance in the
object like another entry in the array to

74
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:24,092
test whether the first is less than the
second as in this example. The key point

75
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:31,010
is that the sort implementation has no
dependence on the type of data that's

76
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:38,250
handled by the Comparable interface and a
different Comparable array will be sorted

77
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,862
in the same way though eventually, because
of the interface mechanism, they call back

78
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:50,944
to the actual compareTo() code that goes
with a type of object being sorted. Now

79
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:57,603
there's a few rules and there's natural
rules but they're worth talking about and

80
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:05,112
paying attention to that the compareTo()
method has to implement in the so called a

81
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:13,220
total order. In all that saying is really
that it must be possible to put items in

82
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,133
order in a sort. So there's three
properties. First one says that if v is

83
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:25,857
less than or equal to w and w is less than
or equal to v then the only way for that

84
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:31,495
to be true is if they're equal and then
there's transitivity. If v less than w, w

85
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:36,736
is less than x, then v must be less than
or equal to x. In totality, is that either

86
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:42,785
v is less than or equal to w or w is less
than equal to v or both they are equal.

87
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:49,420
And there's plenty of natural total orders
in the types of data that we normally want

88
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,097
to consider for sort keys. Like the
integers or natural numbers or real

89
00:08:55,097 --> 00:09:01,185
numbers or alphabetical order for strings,
chronological order for dates or times and

90
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:07,280
so forth. The cartoon on the right shows
that not all orders are necessarily total

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,643
全序。比如，rock，paper，scissors不具有传递性。如果已知 v < w，
orders. So, rock, paper, scissors is intransitive.
If you know that v is less

92
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:17,626
w < v，不能得出v <= v。对不起，
that w, w is less than v, you don't know
that v is less than or equal to v. I'm

93
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:22,135
（如果已知）v < w，w <= x，并不能得出
sorry, v is less than w, w less than equal
to x that you don't necessarily know that

94
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:30,219
v <= x。好。接下来讲Comparable接口，按照惯例，
v is less than or equal to x. Alright. So
the Comparable API then, by convention in

95
在Java中我们总是需要实现compareTo()方法，以使 v与w满足
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:39,003
Java we always need to implement compareTo()
such that v that compared to w is a

96
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:46,852
全序。而且，同样根据惯例，小于返回一个负整数，
total order. And also by convention, it
returns a negative integer for its less

97
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:54,408
等于返回0，大于返回正整数。如果该对象大于
zero if it's equal positive its greater.
If this object is greater than the object

98
00:09:54,408 --> 00:10:00,754
作为参数的对象。如果对象类型不兼容或某一对象为空，
given as argument. If the types are
incompatible or if either one is null

99
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:07,466
compareTo()方法应该抛出异常。再次说明，Java中许多
compareTo() should throw an exception.
Now, again, many of Java's standard types

100
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:15,012
存储数值、日期、文件等的标准数据类型通常都会实现compareTo()方法。
for numbers and dates and files and so
forth implement compareTo() by convention.

101
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:20,018
根据这些原则，如果我们要比较自己的数据类型，那么我们必须
Now if we're going to implement our own
type then we have to go ahead and

102
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:24,092
实现Comparable接口。一般来讲
implement the Comparable interface
according to these rules. And usually

103
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:30,065
这一点是很明确的。所以来看这个例子。这是Java内部Date类的简化版，
that's fairly straightforward. So here's
an example. It's a simplified version of

104
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:37,099
为了展示实现Comparable接口的思想。
the Date class that's implemented within
Java just to show the idea of implementing

105
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:42,029
首先，我们在类声明之后写上implements
Comparable. So, after the class
declaration, we write implements

106 ***
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:48,356
Comparable，然后。。。因为我们仅仅是
Comparable and then we fill in the generic
with the same type because we're only

107
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:53,712
与另一个日期比较。在此接口实现中，Date类有
going to compare dates to other dates. In
this implementation, the Date class has

108
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:58,853
三个实例变量，month，day，year，并且像你们看到的，构造函数
three instance variables. The month, the
day and the year and the constructor

109
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:04,098
将参数值赋给它们。所以现在，如果你想比较两个
fills those from the arguments as you can
see. So now, if you want to compare two

110
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:10,238
不同的日期，那么首先要做的是检查该年份是否小于
different dates then the first thing to do
is to check if this year is less than that

111
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:15,696
另一年份，通过比较年份，这两个日期存在几种情况。如果为真
year, over that is the year given, the
date given in the argument. If that's true

112
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:20,291
那么该年份小，返回-1，如果（为假）该年份大，返回+1。
then it's less return -1 and if it's,
the year is greater, return +1.

113
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:26,226
否则，这两个年份相等，我们必须通过月份来做
Otherwise, the year, years must be equal
so we have to look at the months to do the

114
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:31,964
比较，同理一直比较到日期。当且仅当年份、月份、日期均相等时
compare and so forth down to do the days.
Only if they're all equal that we return

115
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:36,054
返回0。这就是Comparable接口实现的例子，通过
zero. So, that's an example of an
implementation of Comparable by

116
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:42,814
实现compareTo()方法对日期排序。（总之，）
implementing the compareTo() method to put
dates in order as you might expect. So the

117
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:49,775
Java语言通过此Comparable接口机制让我们可以
Java language helps us with this
Comparable mechanism so that we can sort

118
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:55,521
对任何类型的数据排序。当我们接着实现排序算法时，
data of any type. When we continue to
implement sorting algorithms, we're

119
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:02,245
其实是在实现接口。这就是排序算法，
actually even in a hide that beneath our
own implementations. So, that are sorting

120
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:08,728
实际上它们的代码可以用来在许多其他语言中实现排序。
algorithms actually their actual code can
be used to implement sorting in many other

121
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:14,650
方式是采取两个主要操作——比较和
languages. The way we do that is to take
the two primary operations, compares and

122
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,614
交换——来引用数据，并把这两个操作封装成
exchangers that were that were, were used
to refer the data and encapsulate them

123
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:26,137
两个静态方法。所以，我们使用一个less()方法，它需要两个
just the static methods. So, we're going
to use a method less() that takes two

124
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:31,878
可比较的对象作为参数并且返回，v.compareTo(w)小于0。
Comparable objects as arguments and it
just returns, v.compareTo(w) less than

125
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:39,218
然后，对数组元素排序时另一件要做的事是
zero. And then the other thing that we do
when we sort items that are in an array is

126
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:45,861
将索引为i和j的数组元素相交换。
to, to swap or exchange of the item at a
given index i with the one at a given

127
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:52,166
这是每一个程序员首次接触赋值语句就会的。
index j. And that's every programmer's
first introduction to assignment

128
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:59,014
将a[i]存到变量swap，把a[j]赋给a[i]，再把 swap存回
statements. We save a[i] in a variable swap,
put a[j] in a[i], and then put swap back

129
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:05,545
到a[j]。因此现在，使用我们的排序方法引用数据将只使用这两个静态
in a[j]. So now our sort methods to refer
the data will just use this two static

130
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:10,872
方法。而且有一个很好的理由。下面是一个例子。假设我们想
methods. And there's a good reason for
that. Here's an example. Suppose we want

131
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:16,285
测试一个数组是否已排序。那么这是一个静态的方法，数组已排序返回真，
to test if an array is sorted. So this is
a static method that is supposed to return

132
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:21,298
否则返回假。它所做的只是遍历数组
true if the array is sorted and false if it's
not. And all it does is just go through

133
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:26,411
检查是否每个元素都小于
the array from the one to the length of
the array and test if each item is less

134
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:31,440
上一个元素。如果存在某元素小于上一个元素那么该数组
than the one before. If you have an item
that's less than one before then it's not

135
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,352
未排好序，返回假。遍历数组都没有这种情况，
sorted you return false. If you get all
the way through the array without that

136
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:41,482
那么数组已排序。这是非常简单的代码，问题是，
happening, then you say the array is true.
That's pretty simple code, the question

137
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:47,415
如果你有一个排序算法（经此算法排序的数组）通过了测试，你能肯定它
is, if you have a sorting algorithm that
passes that test, are you sure that it

138
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:54,124
就正确地排序了数组吗？ 答案是，是的如果，如果
correctly sorted the array? Well the
answer to that question is, yes if, yes if

139
00:13:54,124 --> 00:14:00,792
你只是用less()和exchange()方法实现、引用数据，
you used only the less() and exchange()
methods to implement, to refer the data

140
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:07,592
因为那样你知道，你用的exchange()方法数组排序后的数据
because then you know because you used the
exchange() method that the data in the array

141
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:13,489
和排序前的数据一样。如果你
after the sort is the same data as was in
the array before the sort, sort. If you

142
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:18,640
有一种排序方法可以在数组中存储任何值，例如
have a sort method that can store any
values in an array, it could, for example,

143
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,337
将每个数组元素存为0，该排序方法（排序的结果）同样能通过测试，但是它不是
store zeros in every array entry that
method would pass this test, but it didn't

144
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:29,046
正确的数组排序，因为它重写了数组元素值。所以我们使用less()
really correctly sort the array because
overwrote all the values. So, we use less()

145
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:39,306
和exchange()方法，确保可以用这种方法测试我们的排序结果。
and exchange() to be sure that we can test
that our, our methods work with the method

146
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:44,056
like this.
