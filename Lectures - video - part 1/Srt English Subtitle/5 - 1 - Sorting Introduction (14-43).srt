1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,616
ok,我们接下来要学习什么呢？让我们从一个典型的
Okay, what are the rules that we're going
to follow? Well, let's start with looking

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:10,094
排序问题开始吧。假如某个大学有许多信息学生记录
at a typical basic sorting problem. Say,
university has student records and for

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:16,094
每一个学生都有一定数量的信息。也许是班级序号、
every student there is a certain amount of
information. Maybe there's a class number,

4
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:22,067
成绩、电话号码或者地址。因此我们引用一项纪录，
there is a grade, there's a phone number
maybe an address so we refer to an item

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:27,304
这项纪录有我们将要排序的信息或者记录。但是
and it has a record or the information
that we're going to sort. But in

6
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:32,118
实际上，记录的某一部分叫做关键字，我们将做的工作就是
particular, there's a piece of a record
called a key and what we want to do is put

7
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:37,175
根据这些关键字来排序记录。这就是排序问题。
the records into order according to the
key. That's the sort problem. Re-arrange

8
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:43,204
根据每一项的关键字，重新升序排列一个n项的数组
an array of n items into ascending order
according to a defined key which is part

9
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:49,165
现在我们的目标是能够排序任何类型的数据，因此让我们
of the item. Now, our goal is to be able
to sort any type of data so let's look at

10
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:55,608
来看两个程序。第一个例子是升序排列一些随机的实数
a couple of client programs. First example
is to just sort some random real numbers

11
00:00:55,608 --> 00:01:00,884
看，这儿有一个客户端来调用我们的插入排序方法，它先
into ascending order. So, here's a client
that calls our insertion sort method and

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,068
从标准输入读取数据到一个数组，然后调用插入排序
all it does is read numbers from standard
input than into an array a then calls

13
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:12,515
最后把排序后数组打印出来。在右边，你能看见
insertion sort and then prints them out.
And you can see on the right that the

14
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:18,581
这些数按顺序被打印出来了。这个看起来像是一个
numbers are printed out in sorted order.
This seems like an artificial kind of

15
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:24,326
人工的输入，但是我们在接下来会看见一个程序。
input but actually we'll look at an
application even in this lecture. And then

16
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:31,300
在一些程序里，随机输入时比较好的输入模型。排序字符串也许是
there are many applications where random
inputs are fine model. Here's maybe a more

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,934
更加常见的排序形式。在这种形式下，它使用我们的
familiar sort client that sort strings.
And in this case it reads the strings from

18
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:44,232
In类中的readString()方法从文件中读入字符串，
a file using our readStrings() method in
our In class that which takes a file as

19
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:50,186
这方法需要一个文件为参数。所以我们将这个文件名作为第一个
argument. So we take the file name as the
first command line argument, read in array

20
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:56,389
命令行参数，从文件中读取字符串到数组中，再一次调用Insertion.sort()方法。
of string from that file separated by
blanks, call an Insertion.sort() method again. So,

21
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:03,047
因此，Insertion.sort是一个需要一个数组作为参数的方法
Insertion.sort is a method that takes an
array a as its parameter and it, it's the

22
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:08,817
这个方法会将这个数组重新排序。在这个例子中，words three.txt
first argument and it rearranges the
strings in that array to be in sorted

23
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:15,571
文件中有一些三个字母的单词，然后这个客户端程序
order. So in this case words, words
three.text has the certain number of three

24
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:22,014
将按照字母序重新排列那些三字母单词。
letter words and this client program will
result in those three letter words being

25
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:27,673
如果我们完成了能够排序任何类型数据的目标的话，
rearranged into alphabetical order.
Here's another client that we could use

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:34,371
这儿是另一个能够使用我们的排序代码的客户端程序。
our sort program for, if we achieved the
goal of sorting any type of data. In this

27
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:41,249
在这个程序中，我们将要排序给定的一些文件的名字。
one, we're going to sort file, file's name
in a given directory. So again we use the

28
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:49,508
我们将再一次使用Java中的File类，我们使用这个类，
File class from Java and we use, we go and
use the listFiles() method from that class

29
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:56,788
然后得到一个包含一些给定文件的文件名数组。那是一个存储
to get an array that contains all the file
names in the given directory. That's an

30
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:03,622
文件名的数组。Insertion.sort()方法需要数组作为第一个
array with file names in it and Insertion.sort()
takes that array as its first

31
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:10,287
参数，然后将他们排序。然后我们继续，最后遍历并将
argument and again sorts them and then we
go ahead and use as, go through them one

32
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:15,754
他们一个个打印出来，最后的结果是按照文件名的顺序给出。
by one and print them and they come out in
order of file name. So that's three

33
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:20,494
ok，这就是三个不同的客户端程序，三个完全不同类型的数据。
different clients, three completely
different types of data. And the first

34
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:25,508
我们不得不思考的这个游戏的第一条规则就是
rule of the game that we have to think
about is, how can we make it so that we

35
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:30,591
我们怎么实现一个能够被三个不同的客户端程序使用去
can implement one sort program that can be
used by these three different clients to

36
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:35,804
排序三种不同类型数据的排序程序。在这种情况下
implement three different types of data.
In the way that, that happens is a

37
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:41,555
一种被称为回调的机制就很有用。因此，我们的
mechanism known as a callback. So, that's
our basic question, how can sort, now, how

38
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:46,629
基本的问题是就由怎么排序变为怎么在不给出关键字的类型信息
to compare data of all those different
types without being given any information

39
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,692
时去比较这些不同类型的数据。答案就是我们制定
about the type of an item's key? And the
answer is that what is we set up a

40
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:59,517
一个被称为回调的机制，或者说是一个在客户端程序可
mechanism known as a callback or reference
to executable code where the client, by

41
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:05,644
执行代码的引用的机制。在Java里面，有一个隐形
passing an array of objects to the sort
function. In Java, there's an implicit

42
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:11,724
机制，这个机制就是说一些存储对象的数组需要有
mechanism that says that any such array of
object is going to have the compareTo()

43
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:17,604
compareTo()方法，然后这个排序函数将调用数组元素
method, then the sort function calls back
the compareTo() method associated with the

44
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:22,351】
的compareTo方法当需要的时候，或者是说需要来比较
objects in the array when it ever needs,
whenever it needs to compare two items.

45
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:26,645
两个元素的时候。有许多不同的方式来实现回调，那是
There's a lot of different ways to
implement callbacks and that's

46
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:32,837
编程语言规范决定的。不同的语言有不同的机制。核心
programming language specific. Different
languages have different mechanisms. It's

47
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:38,780
思想就是将函数作为一个参数传递给其他的函数，这个是结对
all about the idea of passing functions as
arguments to other functions which is the

48
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,206
出现的，回想一下函数式编程和邱奇-图灵理论。
pair and gets into functional programming
and thinking all the way back to Turing and

49
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:50,553
对于Java,因为有编译时类型检查，所以这个回调机制
Church. For Java, because of the desire
to check types at compile time, the use of

50
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:56,246
的用法被称为一个接口，接下来我们将讨论使用java接口
specific method called an interface and
then, we'll look at the details of how to

51
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:01,040
来实现回调的细节。这些内容有点涉及到编程语言
implement callbacks with the Java
interfaces now. It's a little bit of

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,086
的细节，但是这是值得去讨论的。因为它允许我们
programming language detailed but it's,
it's really worthwhile because it allows

53
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:12,011
用一种类型安全的方式，使用自己开发的排序算法来排序任何类型的数据。
us to use the sorts that we developed for
any type of data in a type safe manner. So

54
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:18,084
因此我们已经看过了一些客户端程序。这是排序文件名的
we already looked at some clients. This is
the example of the client program that

55
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:25,001
客户端程序例子。它调用我们的sort()方法，并传递了
sorts the files in a given directory by
file name. So it just calls our sort()

56
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:31,498
一个某种类型的数组作为第一个参数。现在，Java语言内置
method with a, an array some type of
object as first argument. Now, built in to

57
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:37,939
的是一个被称为Comparable的接口，所有的实现comparable接口
Java is the so-called the Comparable
interface and all the Comparable interface

58
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:45,024
都任何数据类型都将实现一个compareTo()方法。
is the specification that a type, data
type that implements Comparable will have

59
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:52,956
它是泛型的，将同确定类型的元素进行比较。
a compareTo() method. And it's generic and
will be compared to against a certain type

60
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:59,902
现在我们将让那些需要排序的对象都实现comparable接口。
of item. Now when we implement objects
that are to be sorted we'll implement the

61
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:06,370
那是顶级类文件实现comparable接口。
Comparable method. That's up in the top
class file, implements comparable file.

62
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,351
因为排序是一种常见的操作，一些常用的标准
And since sorting is an operation that's
used in so many situations, many of the

63
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:20,026
Java类也实现了Comparable接口。
standard Java types that you would expect
to involve sorts will implement

64
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:27,040
也就是说实现了comparable接口的那些类的
Comparable. And all that means is that,
that data type has an instance method that

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,068
实例都实现了compareTo方法，它根据一些
will implement the compareTo() method.
It'll compare this object against the

66
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:40,296
复杂的比较规则来比较方法参数给出的对象和自身对象
object given as argument and depending on
some complicated tests, it'll return -1,

67
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:46,181
返回-1代表小于或者少于，+1代表着大于或多余，0代表相等
meaning less, +1, meaning greater or
0, meaning equal. Now, that compareTo()

68
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:50,726
compareto方法是所有排序实现所必须的方法。
method is really all that the sort
implementation needs. First it says that,

69
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:55,833
首先，假如说，某种排序实现需要一个元素为Comparable类型的数组
that it's going to take as argument an
array of type Comparable. So that means,

70
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:02,023
作为参数，这就意味着数组里面的元素将实现Comparable接口
the objects in the array are going to
implement the Comparable interface or that

71
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:08,000
或者是说会有一个compareTo方法。然后排序代码
it will have a compareTo() method. And then
the sort code can just use that compareTo()

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,052
能够在数组中的某个元素上调用取compareTo方法
method, invoked in a sense of the
object like an entry in the array and as

73
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:19,012
并将另一个数组元素作为参数传入，以此来测试
argument and another instance in the
object like another entry in the array to

74
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:24,092
是否前者小于后者，正如这个例子所展示的一样。
test whether the first is less than the
second as in this example. The key point

75
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:31,010
关键的是排序实现并没有依赖所排序数据
is that the sort implementation has no
dependence on the type of data that's

76
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:38,250
的类型，不同的Comparable数组都将以同样的
handled by the Comparable interface and a
different Comparable array will be sorted

77
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,862
逻辑被排序，因为接口机制，最后他们实际回调待排对象
in the same way though eventually, because
of the interface mechanism, they call back

78
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:50,944
的compareTo方法。现在有几条很简单
to the actual compareTo() code that goes
with a type of object being sorted. Now

79
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:57,603
规则，但是值得我们去讨论和关注这些规则。
there's a few rules and there's natural
rules but they're worth talking about and

80
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:05,112
那就是compareTo方法必须满足全序顺序。
paying attention to that the compareTo()
method has to implement in the so called a

81
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:13,220
总的来说就是，通过排序，总是能够将待排序项
total order. In all that saying is really
that it must be possible to put items in

82
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,133
排列有序。因此，存在三个性质。第一个
order in a sort. So there's three
properties. First one says that if v is

83
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:25,857
如果v <= w，w <= v，那么 v == w，第二就是传递性
less than or equal to w and w is less than
or equal to v then the only way for that

84
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:31,495
如果v <= w， w <= x，那么 v <= x。
to be true is if they're equal and then
there's transitivity. If v less than w, w

85
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:36,736
第三就是，v 与 w的关系之后三种，< 、= 或者 >
is less than x, then v must be less than
or equal to x. In totality, is that either

86
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:42,785
v is less than or equal to w or w is less
than equal to v or both they are equal.

87
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:49,420
在我们想作为排序关键字的数据类型中，有许多
And there's plenty of natural total orders
in the types of data that we normally want

88
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,097
种自然全排序。比如说整数、自然数、实数序，或者字符串
to consider for sort keys. Like the
integers or natural numbers or real

89
00:08:55,097 --> 00:09:01,185
的字母序，日期或时间的日历序等等。
numbers or alphabetical order for strings,
chronological order for dates or times and

90
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:07,280
右边的卡通表明不是所有的顺序都必须是全排序。
so forth. The cartoon on the right shows
that not all orders are necessarily total

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,643
全序。比如，rock，paper，scissors不具有传递性。如果已知 v < w，
orders. So, rock, paper, scissors is intransitive.
If you know that v is less

92
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:17,626
w < v，不能得出v <= v。对不起，
that w, w is less than v, you don't know
that v is less than or equal to v. I'm

93
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:22,135
（如果已知）v < w，w <= x，并不能得出
sorry, v is less than w, w less than equal
to x that you don't necessarily know that

94
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:30,219
v <= x。好。接下来讲Comparable接口，按照惯例，
v is less than or equal to x. Alright. So
the Comparable API then, by convention in

95
在Java中我们总是需要实现compareTo()方法，以使 v与w满足
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:39,003
Java we always need to implement compareTo()
such that v that compared to w is a

96
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:46,852
全序。而且，同样根据惯例，小于返回一个负整数，
total order. And also by convention, it
returns a negative integer for its less

97
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:54,408
等于返回0，大于返回正整数。如果该对象大于
zero if it's equal positive its greater.
If this object is greater than the object

98
00:09:54,408 --> 00:10:00,754
作为参数的对象。如果对象类型不兼容或某一对象为空，
given as argument. If the types are
incompatible or if either one is null

99
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:07,466
compareTo()方法应该抛出异常。再次说明，Java中许多
compareTo() should throw an exception.
Now, again, many of Java's standard types

100
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:15,012
存储数值、日期、文件等的标准数据类型通常都会实现compareTo()方法。
for numbers and dates and files and so
forth implement compareTo() by convention.

101
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:20,018
根据这些原则，如果我们要比较自己的数据类型，那么我们必须
Now if we're going to implement our own
type then we have to go ahead and

102
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:24,092
实现Comparable接口。一般来讲
implement the Comparable interface
according to these rules. And usually

103
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:30,065
这一点是很明确的。所以来看这个例子。这是Java内部Date类的简化版，
that's fairly straightforward. So here's
an example. It's a simplified version of

104
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:37,099
为了展示实现Comparable接口的思想。
the Date class that's implemented within
Java just to show the idea of implementing

105
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:42,029
首先，我们在类声明之后写上implements
Comparable. So, after the class
declaration, we write implements

106 
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:48,356
***Comparable，然后。。。因为我们仅仅是
Comparable and then we fill in the generic
with the same type because we're only

107
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:53,712
与另一个日期比较。在此接口实现中，Date类有
going to compare dates to other dates. In
this implementation, the Date class has

108
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:58,853
三个实例变量，month，day，year，并且像你们看到的，构造函数
three instance variables. The month, the
day and the year and the constructor

109
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:04,098
将参数值赋给它们。所以现在，如果你想比较两个
fills those from the arguments as you can
see. So now, if you want to compare two

110
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:10,238
不同的日期，那么首先要做的是检查该年份是否小于
different dates then the first thing to do
is to check if this year is less than that

111
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:15,696
另一年份，通过比较年份，这两个日期存在几种情况。如果为真
year, over that is the year given, the
date given in the argument. If that's true

112
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:20,291
那么该年份小，返回-1，如果（为假）该年份大，返回+1。
then it's less return -1 and if it's,
the year is greater, return +1.

113
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:26,226
否则，这两个年份相等，我们必须通过月份来做
Otherwise, the year, years must be equal
so we have to look at the months to do the

114
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:31,964
比较，同理一直比较到日期。当且仅当年份、月份、日期均相等时
compare and so forth down to do the days.
Only if they're all equal that we return

115
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:36,054
返回0。这就是Comparable接口实现的例子，通过
zero. So, that's an example of an
implementation of Comparable by

116
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:42,814
实现compareTo()方法对日期排序。（总之，）
implementing the compareTo() method to put
dates in order as you might expect. So the

117
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:49,775
Java语言通过此Comparable接口机制让我们可以
Java language helps us with this
Comparable mechanism so that we can sort

118
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:55,521
对任何类型的数据排序。当我们接着实现排序算法时，
data of any type. When we continue to
implement sorting algorithms, we're

119
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:02,245
其实是在实现接口。这就是排序算法，
actually even in a hide that beneath our
own implementations. So, that are sorting

120
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:08,728
实际上它们的代码可以用来在许多其他语言中实现排序。
algorithms actually their actual code can
be used to implement sorting in many other

121
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:14,650
方式是采取两个主要操作——比较和
languages. The way we do that is to take
the two primary operations, compares and

122
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,614
交换——来引用数据，并把这两个操作封装成
exchangers that were that were, were used
to refer the data and encapsulate them

123
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:26,137
两个静态方法。所以，我们使用一个less()方法，它需要两个
just the static methods. So, we're going
to use a method less() that takes two

124
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:31,878
可比较的对象作为参数并且返回，v.compareTo(w)小于0。
Comparable objects as arguments and it
just returns, v.compareTo(w) less than

125
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:39,218
然后，对数组元素排序时另一件要做的事是
zero. And then the other thing that we do
when we sort items that are in an array is

126
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:45,861
将索引为i和j的数组元素相交换。
to, to swap or exchange of the item at a
given index i with the one at a given

127
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:52,166
这是每一个程序员首次接触赋值语句就会的。
index j. And that's every programmer's
first introduction to assignment

128
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:59,014
将a[i]存到变量swap，把a[j]赋给a[i]，再把 swap存回
statements. We save a[i] in a variable swap,
put a[j] in a[i], and then put swap back

129
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:05,545
到a[j]。因此现在，使用我们的排序方法引用数据将只使用这两个静态
in a[j]. So now our sort methods to refer
the data will just use this two static

130
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:10,872
方法。而且有一个很好的理由。下面是一个例子。假设我们想
methods. And there's a good reason for
that. Here's an example. Suppose we want

131
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:16,285
测试一个数组是否已排序。那么这是一个静态的方法，数组已排序返回真，
to test if an array is sorted. So this is
a static method that is supposed to return

132
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:21,298
否则返回假。它所做的只是遍历数组
true if the array is sorted and false if it's
not. And all it does is just go through

133
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:26,411
检查是否每个元素都小于
the array from the one to the length of
the array and test if each item is less

134
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:31,440
上一个元素。如果存在某元素小于上一个元素那么该数组
than the one before. If you have an item
that's less than one before then it's not

135
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,352
未排好序，返回假。遍历数组都没有这种情况，
sorted you return false. If you get all
the way through the array without that

136
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:41,482
那么数组已排序。这是非常简单的代码，问题是，
happening, then you say the array is true.
That's pretty simple code, the question

137
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:47,415
如果你有一个排序算法（经此算法排序的数组）通过了测试，你能肯定它
is, if you have a sorting algorithm that
passes that test, are you sure that it

138
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:54,124
就正确地排序了数组吗？ 答案是，是的如果，如果
correctly sorted the array? Well the
answer to that question is, yes if, yes if

139
00:13:54,124 --> 00:14:00,792
你只是用less()和exchange()方法实现、引用数据，
you used only the less() and exchange()
methods to implement, to refer the data

140
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:07,592
因为那样你知道，你用的exchange()方法数组排序后的数据
because then you know because you used the
exchange() method that the data in the array

141
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:13,489
和排序前的数据一样。如果你
after the sort is the same data as was in
the array before the sort, sort. If you

142
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:18,640
有一种排序方法可以在数组中存储任何值，例如
have a sort method that can store any
values in an array, it could, for example,

143
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,337
将每个数组元素存为0，该排序方法（排序的结果）同样能通过测试，但是它不是
store zeros in every array entry that
method would pass this test, but it didn't

144
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:29,046
正确的数组排序，因为它重写了数组元素值。所以我们使用less()
really correctly sort the array because
overwrote all the values. So, we use less()

145
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:39,306
和exchange()方法，确保可以用这种方法测试我们的排序结果。
and exchange() to be sure that we can test
that our, our methods work with the method

146
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:44,056
like this.
