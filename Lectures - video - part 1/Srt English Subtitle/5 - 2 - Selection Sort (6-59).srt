1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:06,048
我们要看的第一个基本的排序方法很简单，
The first elementary sorting method that
we're going to take a look at is an easy

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:11,083
叫做选择排序。选择排序的思想是从
method known as selection sort. The idea
of selection sort, is start out with a

3
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:17,101
一个未排序的数组开始，我们将以这些扑克牌为例。在第i次循环中，
unsorted array and we'll use these playing
cards as an example. And in the ith iteration,

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:22,867
遍历数组在剩余元素中找到最小项，本例中，
we go through the array to try to find the
smallest remaining entry, in this case,

5
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:28,693
2是最小的元素。然后我们将其与第一个元素交换，
the 2 is the smallest from any entry. And
then we'll swap that with the first entry

6
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:34,199
这样就完成了一个步骤。选择排序基于
in the array and then we know we've got
one step done. Selection sort is based on

7
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:39,376
迭代思想。好，因此，基本的选择排序方法是，在第i次
iterating that idea. Okay. So, the basic
selection sort method is to, in the ith

8
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:44,626
迭代时从剩余元素中找到最小项，从第i个元素右侧或者
iteration, find the smallest remaining
entry and to the right of i or bigger

9
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:50,252
索引大于i的元素中，然后将最小项跟第i个元素交换。因此，从i在最左侧开始，
index than i and then swap that with i.
So, we start out i is at the left end and

10
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:55,711
接着是剩余的，所有右侧剩余的。扫描一遍，
then the remaining, all the remaining
entries to the right. We scan through and

11
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:02,516
最小项是2，从右数的第三项，进行交换。
the smallest one is the two, three entries
from the right so we swap that. So that's

12
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:08,889
这就是第一步。现在，第i个元素左侧已经排好序，
the first step. Now, that part of the
array to the left of i is in it's final

13
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:15,193
我们只需要继续。所以现在，最小的是三。和第i项交换，
order and we simply continue. So now, the
smallest is the three. Swap that with i,

14
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:21,511
i自增。现在2和3都排好序了，继续这样的步骤。找到
increment i. So now, we have the two and
three in order, continuing that way. Find

15
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:27,958
（右侧）最小项，4。将4与第i项交换，i自增。找到最小项，
the smallest, the four. Swap that one with
i, increment i. Find the smallest, it's

16
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:34,712
5，与第i项交换，i自增。找到最小项，与第i项交换，i自增。
five, swap that with i, increment i. Find
the smallest, swap that with i, increment

17
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:40,689
每次（迭代）都必须依次扫描剩余的元素
i.  Each time we have to scan
through all the remaining entries in order

18
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:45,788
来找到最小的一项。但是，一旦找到，只需要交换这两张牌，
to find the smallest. But then, once we
found it, we only have to swap two cards

19
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,898
这是选择排序的关键属性。现在8是最小的，
those are both key properties of selection
sort. Now the eight is the smallest and we

20
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:59,486
交换。现在我们知道它们是有序的，但程序不是这样，我们必须
swap. And now, we know they're in order
but the program doesn't so we have to look

21
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:06,816
确定i和n是相同的，然后与自己交换，
and decide that i and n are the same and
then it swaps it with itself and does the

22
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:13,226
直到最后一次迭代。经过这样的过程，我们才能确定整个
same thing for the last. And so, after
that process, then we know that the entire

23
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:19,445
数组已经排好序。好。理解某个算法如何工作的一种方法
array is in its final order, all sorted.
Alright. So let's, one way to understand

24
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:24,768
是考虑不变量。所以，对选择排序来说，
the way that an algorithm works is to
think about invariants . So, for the

25
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:30,924
我们有一个指针，也就是变量i，它从左侧扫描到
selection sort, we have a pointer that was
our variable i, that scans from left to

26
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:36,345
右侧。现在，用一个小红箭头表示i。
right. Now, it's indicated by a little red
arrow in this representation. The

27
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:42,235
不变量就是箭头左侧的元素，箭头左侧的元素保持不变
invariants are that the entries on onto
the left of the arrow are never changed

28
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:48,743
并且升序排列。箭头右侧的元素没有一个小于
and they're in ascending order. No entry
to the right of the arrow is smaller than

29
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:54,859
左侧的元素。i就是这样设定的。
any entry to the left of it. That's the
way that we set it up. And the algorithm

30
00:02:54,859 --> 00:03:00,837
maintains those invariants by finding the
smallest entry to the right and exchange

31
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:06,827
it with the next one. So the code
implements the invariants. So, to move the

32
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:12,739
pointer to the right, we increment i. So,
now the invariant might be violated so we

33
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:18,425
have to fix it. It might be violated
because you might have an element to the

34
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:23,812
right of the pointer that is 
smaller than some, the element on the

35
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:29,143
pointer. So, what we have to do is
identify the index or that minimum entry

36
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:34,170
and exchange it. Then once we've exchanged
it, again, we preserved our invariant.

37
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,846
After that point, no element to the left
of the pointer is going to change and all

38
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:44,536
the element, there's no smaller element to
the right. [cough] and that gives us

39
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:52,713
immediately our code for the selection
sort implementation. We identify the, the

40
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:59,009
length of the array that's n. Then we
have a for loop that goes through every

41
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:05,112
element in the array, we keep a variable
min in that is the index of the going to

42
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:10,045
be the index of the smallest element to
the right of pointer i. We have an

43
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:15,626
inter-for loop that for j, if it finds a
smaller one, resets min and then once

44
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:21,509
we've looked at all the elements to the
right of i we exchange the smallest one

45
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:27,083
with i. That's a complete implementation
of selection sort. Now it's easy to

46
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:34,073
develop on mathematical model for the cost
of selection sort and here's the

47
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:42,054
proposition that describes that.
Selections or uses about N^2 / 2

48
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:48,011
compares and exactly n exchanges. And
just looking at this trace of selection

49
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:55,525
sort and operation really is a proof,
visual proof of this proposition. In this

50
00:04:55,525 --> 00:05:00,493
diagram, the entries in black, are the
ones that are examined in order to find

51
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:06,621
the minimum each time with the minimum in
red. Entries in gray are not touched,

52
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:12,492
they're in their final position. Well, you
can see that this isn't going to be in

53
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:19,709
general an N by N square and about half of the
elements in the square are black or about

54
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:27,029
N^2 / 2 and you can see also the exact
formula (N - 1) + (N - 2) and so forth

55
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:33,329
is the total number of compares used. And
then on each of the Ns values of the

56
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:40,218
variable i there's an exchange so that's
the cost in terms of the number of

57
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:48,070
exchanges. Now, what's interesting about
this proposition about selection sort is

58
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,257
that, it doesn't matter what order the
input is. Selection sort is going to use

59
00:05:54,257 --> 00:06:00,458
quadratic time because it always has to go
through the whole thing to look for the

60
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:06,752
minimum. And another property is that you
can't sort moving less data because

61
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:12,842
selection sort does just a linear number
of exchanges. Every item is put in to

62
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:19,459
it's final position with just one
exchange. Let's look at an animation of

63
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:25,693
selection sort in operation. [cough] You
can see our pointer moving from right to

64
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:31,919
left every time it finds the smallest
element to the right, it exchanges it into

65
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,637
position. Now, if the array is partially
sorted, it doesn't matter to selection

66
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:45,854
sort. Still has to go through, even if
it's totally sorted, still has to go

67
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:51,359
through to the side where that minimum
element is. That selection sort, our first

68
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:59,072
elementary sorting method.
