1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,480
Here's another simple client program for
symbol tables related to indexing.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,710
Again, another common function that's
easily handled by symbol tables.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,240
There's all kinds of cases where we just
have a lot of information, maybe on our PC

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,430
or all over the web, and we want to create
an index that allows us to specify.

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,180
A search key and get all the associated
information.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,540
And you've, you've used programs like this

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,445
on, on your computer many instances, most
likely.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,780
So, more generally, here's the goal.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,950
So, we're going to list of files that are
specified.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,210
And then, and maybe it's all files on the

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,870
computer, or maybe it's specified in, in
some other way.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,930
And what we want to do is create an index,
so that we can efficiently

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,040
find all the files that contain a given
query.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,540
String.

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,690
so, in this small example.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,960
So, our client is going to called file
index.

17
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,440
And in this small example say we are going
to have five text files.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,740
And these are just pieces of literature.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,450
And so what we want to do is, build and
index from that set of text files.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
And then given a key, a string key, we
want

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,830
it to print out the files that might
contain that key.

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,200
So, for example, the word freedom appears
in the

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,730
Magna Ca, Carta and in Moby Dick and A
Tale

24
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,290
of Two Cities [COUGH] in all three of them

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,020
but not in Tom Sawyer and not in Aesop's
Fables.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,460
The word whale is only in, Moby Dick.

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,520
The word lamb appears both in Tom Sawyer
and Aesop's Fables, and so forth.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,230
So we're looking for a piece of
information somewhere in a computer,

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,300
and it'll give us the names of the files
that contain that information.

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,290
so, with the, more [COUGH] complex user
interface, this is, very

31
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,270
much what the spotlight or find function
on your computer is doing.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,610
And a programmer might use the same

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,180
program, to find places where certain,
Programming

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,430
terms are used in a bunch of programs.

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,590
So, normally we have a bunch of dot

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,980
java files when we're working on an
application.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,820
Like these are all the ones associated
with

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,100
this, lecture, so we might build an index
from

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,360
that set of files, and then we might

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,620
wonder well where do we use the import
statements.

41
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,820
So we just search for import and it'll
tell us,

42
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,300
look in those three files.
Or, did we use comparators anywhere here?

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,690
In, this Index will tell us no.

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,450
So again, a very general capability that's
got lots and lots of

45
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,870
applications and easy to implement with
our symbol table api.

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,470
And the idea is, that what we're going to
do is associate.

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,860
On keys with values well the key is

48
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,200
the string we type what's the value?

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,670
Well what we're going to use for value is
a

50
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,100
set of files, the files that contain the
query string.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,980
So just given that high level description
then the implimintation is pretty direct.

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,190
Here's the implementation of file index
using our symbol file implimintation.

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,920
So now we're going to build a symbol
table.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,540
That associates string keys with sets of
files.

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,460
So this creates a new symbol table

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,430
associating string keys with sets of
files.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,790
So first thing we do, as before, is build
the index.

58
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,860
So we're going to take, this time we're
going to take

59
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,470
the list of file names from the command
line.

60
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,590
And [COUGH] for each file we're going to
create an input stream.

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,380
We're going to read every word in the file
if

62
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,590
the symbol contains does not contain the
word.

63
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,450
Will create a new set for that word and
put that in the symbol table,

64
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,410
and then, we simply get the set

65
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,530
associated with the key and add the new
word to that set, the new file

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,990
name to that set.
So, this one, for each word in the file.

67
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,520
It'll add that file name to the
corresponding set for that word.

68
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,170
That's building a symbol table associating
keys with sets of files.

69
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,210
And then processing queries is the same as
before, as

70
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,890
long as standard in is not empty we take a
query.

71
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,850
And then simply print out the set of
strings associated

72
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,300
with that word which is a list of file
names.

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,870
So again,

74
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,280
our symbol table API gives a very easy way
to

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,200
implement this file indexing function,
which is very widely useful.

76
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,480
And similarly, maybe we want to build a, a
book

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,900
index, maybe for a real book, or maybe for
an ebook.

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,460
Or more generally, people want to often
process,

79
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,120
preprocess text to, maybe a huge amount of
text,

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,370
to support, so called, concordance
queries.

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,600
So what you want to do, is given a word,

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,810
find all occurrences of that word along
with immediate contexts.

83
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,580
And context just means a few words before
and a few words after.

84
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:32,430
So for example, in tail of two cities.
The words cities actually only appears in

85
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,660
this one place and this is [COUGH] Context
that it appears.

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,930
With the forwards tongues of the two
before and that were blended in after.

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,120
The word majesty appears in three places,
and there's, there's the context.

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,540
In well, this is, the very special case
that you're very familiar with.

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,920
In web searches.

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,520
You type in a word, and then you get

91
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,600
places that, where that word appears in
context.

92
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,410
Again, our symbol table API provides for
an easy way to implement this.

93
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,828
This is a, a.

94
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:14,150
[COUGH] concordance client that that does
the job.

95
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,950
Now what we want to do is read text, and
we want to build an index for each word.

96
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,812
So this is a

97
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:29,360
[COUGH] a, a java construct for.
Reading all the strings

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,630
on an input stream, on standard input,
and, splitting em by

99
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,410
blank space and putting em into array, so
now all the words, are, in the an array.

100
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,780
On standard input.

101
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,460
And then we're going to create a new
symbol table that associates

102
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,130
strings with sets of integers.

103
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,410
And again the string is the key and the
sets of integers

104
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,990
are going to be the places in the array
where the given work appears.

105
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,280
So, we go through.
All the words, pick out our key, s, and

106
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,520
again, if, it's not there yet, we create a
new set associated with that s, and,

107
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,240
then, afterwards, we go ahead and.

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,470
Get that set, and put the new index on
that set.

109
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,060
And then that allows us to process
queries, where we take a

110
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,230
query, and then get the set of indices
associated with that query.

111
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,430
And then we left out, left out the code

112
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,160
where you print out the nine words that
you want.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
The four to the left and the four to the
right.

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,290
Again, quite useful and familiar
functionality and very

115
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,010
easy to implement with our simul table
client.
