1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:06,058
Alright. Now that we've seen efficient
implementations of algorithms that can

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:12,025
solve the unifying problem for huge
problem instances let's look to see how

3
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:17,095
that might be applied. There's a huge
number of applications of Union-find. We

4
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:24,005
talked about dynamic connectivity in
networks there's many other examples in

5
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:30,008
our computational infrastructure. Down at
the bottom is one of those important one

6
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:36,018
is in image processing for understanding
how to label areas in images. We'll see

7
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:41,057
later Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
algorithm, which is a graph processing

8
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:48,009
algorithm which uses Union-find as a
subroutine. There's algorithms in physics

9
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:54,077
for understanding physical phenomenon that
we'll look at an example and many others

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,064
on this list. So, the one we're going to
talk about now is called percolation.

11
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:07,046
That's a model for many physical systems
I'll give an abstract model and then just

12
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:13,063
talk briefly about how it applies to
physical systems. So let's think of an n

13
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:20,076
by n grid of squares that we call sites.
And we'll say that each site is open.

14
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:27,076
That's white in the diagram with probably
P or blocked, that's black of the diagram

15
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:34,029
with probability one - P and we define a
system to, we say that a system is

16
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:40,059
percolated if the top and the bottom are
connected by open sites. So the system at

17
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:46,089
the left, you can find a way to get from
the top to the bottom through white

18
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:53,019
squares, but the system to the right does
not percolate, there's no way to get from

19
00:01:53,019 --> 00:02:00,017
the top to the bottom through white
squares. So, that's a model for many

20
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:05,098
systems. You can think of for electricity.
You could think of a vacant site as being

21
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:11,091
a conductor and, and a block site as being
insulated. And so if there's a conductor

22
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:17,091
from top to bottom then the thing conducts
electricity. Or, you could think of it as,

23
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:23,039
as water flowing through a porous
substance of some kind. Where a vacant

24
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,055
side is just empty and a block side has
got some material, and either the water

25
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:34,030
flows through from top to bottom, or not.
Or you could think of a social network

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,869
where it's people connected and either
there's a c onnection between two people

27
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:46,063
or not and these are a way not to get from
one group of people to another

28
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:52,076
communicating through that social network.
That's just a few examples of the

29
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:58,089
percolation model. So if we, we are
talking abouta randomized model where the

30
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:05,075
sites are vacant with the given
probability. And so it's pretty clear that

31
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:11,087
if it's. Probability that a site is vacant
is low as on the left, two examples on the

32
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:17,002
left in this diagram, it's not going to
percolate. There's not enough open site

33
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:22,016
for there to be a connection from the top
to the bottom. If the probability is high

34
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:26,002
and there is a lot of open sides, it
definitely is going to percolate. There

35
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:30,055
would be lots of ways to get from the top
to the bottom. But in the middle, when

36
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:35,067
it's medium, it's questionable whether it
percolates or not. So the scientific

37
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:40,065
question, or the, mathematical question
from this model is, how do we know,

38
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:46,062
whether it's going to percolate or not? In
this problem and in many similar problems,

39
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:52,034
there's what's called a phase transition.
Which says that, you know, when it's low,

40
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:56,072
it's not going to percolate. When it's
high, it is going to percolate. And

41
00:03:56,072 --> 00:04:02,003
actually, the threshold between when it
percolates and when it doesn't percolate

42
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:07,092
is very sharp. And actually there is a
value as N gets large that if you're less

43
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:13,089
than that value it almost certainly will
not percolate, if you're greater it almost

44
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:19,045
certainly will. The question is what is
that value. This is an example of a

45
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:26,051
mathematical model where the problem is,
is very well articulated. What's that

46
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:32,092
threshold value but, nobody knows the
solution to that mathematical problem. The

47
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:37,032
only solution we have comes from a
computational model, where we run

48
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:42,082
simulations to try and determine the value
of that probability. And those simulations

49
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:47,093
are only enable by fast union find
algorithms, that's our motivating example

50
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:53,024
for why we might need fast union find
algorithms, so let's look at that. So what

51
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:59,053
we're going to run is called a so called
Monte Carlo simulation. Where we

52
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:06,063
initialize the whole grid to be block ed
all black and then we randomly fill in

53
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:12,096
open sites. And we keep going. And every
time we add an open site, we check to see

54
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:18,095
if it makes the system percolate. And we
keep going until we get to a point where

55
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:24,026
the system percolates. And we can show
that the vacancy percentage at the time

56
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:29,080
that it percolates is an estimate of this
threshold value. So what we want to do is

57
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,008
run this experiment millions of times,
which we can do in a computer, as long as

58
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:40,069
we can, efficiently do the calculation of
does it percolate or not. That's a Monte

59
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,064
Carlo simulation, a computational problem
that gives us a solution to this,

60
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:51,012
scientifc problem where, mathematical
problems nobody knows how to solve yet.

61
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:56,097
So, let's, look in a little bit more
detail of how we're going to use our

62
00:05:56,097 --> 00:06:03,092
dynam-, dynamic connectivity model to do
this. So, it's clear that, we'll create an

63
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:09,093
object corresponding to each site. And
we'll give'em a name, from zero to N^2-1

64
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:16,091
as indicated here. And then we'll connect
them together. If they're connected by

65
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:23,029
open sites. So the percolation model on
the left corresponds to the, connection

66
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:28,089
model on the right, according to what
we've been doing. Now, you might say,

67
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:33,081
well, what we want to do is, connect,
check whether any site in the bottom row

68
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:39,039
is connected to any site in the top row,
and use union find for that. Problem with

69
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,091
that is, that would be a brute force
algorithm. Would be quadratic, right on

70
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:50,030
the face of it. Because it would have N^2,
calls to find, to check whether they're

71
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,048
connected. For each site on the top, I'd
check each site on the bottom. Much too

72
00:06:55,048 --> 00:07:01,024
slow. Instead, what we do is create a
virtual site on the top and on the bottom.

73
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:06,087
And then, when we want to know whether
this system percolates, we just check

74
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:14,025
whether the virtual top site is connected
to the virtual bottom site. So how do we

75
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:20,097
model opening a new site? Well to open a
site we just connect it to all it's

76
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:28,034
adjacent open sites. So that's a few calls
to Union but that's easy to implement. And

77
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:34,092
then with that, simple, relationship we
can use the exactly the code that we

78
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:42,000
developed to go ahead and run a simulation
for this connectivity problem. And that's

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,082
where we get the result that, by running
enough simulations for a big-enough n,

80
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:55,409
that this, percolation threshold is about
.592746. With this fast algorithm we can

81
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:01,693
get an accurate answer to the scientific
question. If we use a slow Union-find

82
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:06,822
algorithm we won't be able to run it for
very big problems and we won't get a very

83
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:11,979
accurate answer. So in summary, we took an
important problem. The, the dynamic

84
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,359
connectivity problem. We modeled the
problem to try to understand precisely

85
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:22,109
what kinds of data structures and
algorithms we'd need to solve it. We saw a

86
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:26,676
few easy algorithms for solving the
problem, and quickly saw that they were

87
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:31,953
inadequate for addressing huge problems.
But then we saw how to improve them to get

88
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:37,300
efficient algorithms. And then left us
with, applications that, could not be

89
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,768
solved without these efficient algorithms.
All of this involves the scientific

90
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:47,954
method. For algorithm design where we try
to develop mathematical models that help

91
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:52,343
us understand the properties of the
algorithms that we're developing. And then

92
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:56,675
we test those models through
experimentation enabling us to improve

93
00:08:56,675 --> 00:09:02,363
algorithms iterating, developing better
algorithms and more refined models until

94
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:07,061
we get what we need to solve the practical
problems that we have of interest. That's

95
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:12,165
going to be the overall architecture for
studying algorithms that we're going to

96
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,036
use throughout the course.
