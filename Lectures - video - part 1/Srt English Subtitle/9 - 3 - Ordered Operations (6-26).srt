1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:08,032
When keys are comparable and we can put
them in order. We saw that we can use

2
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:14,014
binary search to get an efficient symbol
table implementation. But we can also

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:20,026
provide a lot of convenient functionality
for the client that's what we are going to

4
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:26,016
look at next. So this is just an example
of an application that might try to

5
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:30,093
associate keys with values. An
illustration of all the different

6
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:37,020
operations that a client might want. So we
already looked at the Get operation so we

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,050
might want to know what city is associated
with the event that happened at time nine

8
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,058
o'clock, thirteenth and so that should
return that value. But there's plenty of

9
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:56,743
other things that we might want. Like, for
example, what's the earliest time? That's

10
00:00:56,743 --> 00:01:03,394
the min or what's the latest time? That's
the max. What about, being able to iterate

11
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:09,463
between, among all the keys between two
given times? That, certainly is

12
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:17,044
convenient. Then there's, what's the
seventh largest times, that's select that

13
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:24,489
like a median, it generalizes min or max?
Which key is that, happens second or

14
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:31,006
seventh? So that's, order statistics, a
dynamic thing what happened, whats the

15
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:38,143
closest time, thing that happened just
before, five past nine. Certainly, plenty

16
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:43,472
of clients might want, want that. So this
one is, I've only got ten tickets to sell.

17
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:49,129
So that's the cut off point for, selling,
seven tickets that's the cut off point.

18
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:53,813
For, anybody after that time doesn't get a
ticket. And, and this one might be, if

19
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:58,827
there's a time cut off. I'm not going to
sell tickets to anyone that came after

20
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:03,466
that time. And then the corresponding one
is, what's the first thing that happened

21
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:09,359
after that time? That's call in to the
radio show, I'm going to take that caller,

22
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:16,330
the first call that comes at nine:30. And
so forth. So then see how many things

23
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,787
happen between nine:15 and nine:25. And
how many calls were there before

24
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:27,550
nine:10:25? So you can see that there's,
all of these operations are quite natural

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,473
when we have the, table in sorted order.
And that's what we have for our binary

26
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:41,128
search implementation. So we can,
implement these, efficiently and they are,

27
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:49,841
convenient and useful for the clients. So
typically for ordered simple tables, when

28
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:57,753
keys are comparable will provide a much
wider interface it's very useful for many

29
00:02:57,753 --> 00:03:06,548
clients. So we say that we're dealing with
keys that are comparable by simply adding

30
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:13,746
this extents comparable key to our
declaration. Same way we did for sorting

31
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:20,179
methods. So all that means is that our
implementations can use compared to but

32
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:25,501
for the client it means that all these
operations have meaning. Give me the

33
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:30,921
minimum key, give me the largest key, and
then I can get the value associated with

34
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:36,883
that using that. Give me the largest key
less than or equal to this key value or

35
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:42,531
the smallest key greater than that key
value, give me the number of keys less

36
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:47,897
than that key. You can actually implement
priority queues this way. Delete the

37
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:55,323
minimum key, delete the largest key. Now
usually we argue against why the interface

38
00:03:55,323 --> 00:04:02,534
is just adding operations to an interface,
usually our reason for doing so is that we

39
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:08,644
can't guarantee that all the operations
can be performing efficiently. In this

40
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:14,077
case, as we'll see, ultimately we have
ways to guarantee that all the operations

41
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:19,267
can be formed efficiently. And they're so
convenient for clients. It's certainly

42
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:24,594
worth adding them. So we have iterate
through all the keys, and iterate through

43
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:30,268
all the keys in a given range, and count
the number of keys in a given range. All

44
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:35,876
of these operations are very useful for
clients and we'll see plenty of examples

45
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:41,280
later on. So we have to greatly expand
our, our table. What, what are going to be

46
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,615
the cost of all of these things. And this
is a big difference between the binary

47
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:51,746
search implementation where the keys are
kept in order in an array, in the

48
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:56,483
sequential search implementation, when
they're all in a link list. So, for

49
00:04:56,483 --> 00:05:01,875
example, to provide order and iteration,
you have to get them sorted. And that's,

50
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:07,204
going to be a lot of work, and take N lg N
time. Whereas binary search, you just

51
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:14,275
iterate through, the things in order. The
give me the seventh key we just go and

52
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:21,611
look there, they are in order. Rank
operation, that is essentially what binary

53
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:28,433
search provides. That's the, our basic
implementation is providing rank. Floor

54
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:35,290
and ceiling that's again is an outgrowth
of the rank operation. Minimum and maximum

55
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,414
well again those are like select. Their
just right there, you look at the first or

56
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:47,711
the last. To insert or delete however
takes linear time. To maintain the sorted

57
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:53,664
array in dynamic fashion is going to take
linear time you have to go through the

58
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:59,775
whole thing. And so that's really are the
key to thinking about what are symbol

59
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:06,117
table and symbol tables in general. How
could we guarantee that all operations are

60
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:12,042
fast? Binary research is pretty good but
that's a major flaw. It can't maintain a

61
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:17,559
dynamic table efficiently with binary
search and that's going to be your focus

62
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,078
in the next lecture
