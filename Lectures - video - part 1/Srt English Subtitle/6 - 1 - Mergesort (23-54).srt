1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,080
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,380
Today we're going to look at Mergesort,
which is one of two

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,880
classic sorting algorithms that are
critical

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,340
components in the world's computational
infrastructure.

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,398
We have a full scientific understanding of
the

6
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:19,896
properties of these algorithms, and
they've been developed

7
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,130
as practical system sorts and application
sorts that

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,560
have been heavily used over the past 50
years.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,550
In fact Quicksort, which we'll consider

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,470
next time, was honored as one of the top

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,990
10 algorithms of the 20th century in
science and engineering.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,540
On this lecture we're going to look in
Mergesort, which is

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,629
the basic sort in plenty of different
programming systems including Java.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,750
Next time we'll look at Quicksort which

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,520
is also used in Java for different
applications.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,320
Alright, so basic Mergesort algorithm.
What's it going to look like?

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,530
The idea is very simple.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,820
What we're going to do is divide an array
into two halves.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,200
Recursively, recursively sort each of the
halves.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,840
And then merge the result.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,720
That's the over-view of Mergesort.

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,240
It was actually one of the first

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,270
non trivial algorithms I implemented on a
computer.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,450
John Von Norman realized that the
development of

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,300
the EDVAC, his EDVAC computer, one of the
first

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,080
general purpose computers that is going to
need

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,230
a sorting method and he came up with
Mergesort.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,951
He's widely accredited as being the
inventor of Mergesort.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,220
So the idea of Mergesort is, is based on
the idea of merging.

30
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:44,982
And so to understand how merging works
we'll

31
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:48,730
think about the idea of an abstract in
place merge.

32
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,470
So, we've got an array A and its first
half is sorted and its second half is

33
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:01,420
sorted and the computation we need to
perform is to replace that with the sorted

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,880
array where those two sub-halves are
merged together.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,855
Let's look at a demo.

36
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:11,290
[COUGH]

37
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,200
The method that we're going to use is
based

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,880
on taking an auxiliary array to hold the
data.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,100
This is a, one of the easiest ways to
implement the merge.

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,890
So the first thing we do is copy
everything over to the auxiliary array.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,580
Now, once that's done, what we'll want to
do is copy

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,160
back to the original array to get it in
sorted order.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,930
In order to do that, we're going to
maintain three indices.

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,320
I, the current entry in the left half, j,
the current entry on the right half and

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,100
k, the current entry in the sorted result.
[COUGH] so the first thing we

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:00,000
do is, take the smaller of the two entries
pointed to by i and j, and compare

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,210
those, and take the smallest one, and move
that one to be the next item output.

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,170
And whichever one is taken, we increment
its pointer.

49
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,450
Now we compare the minimum again, again,
the one pointed group

50
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,030
by j is smaller, so we move that one to k.

51
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,810
Increment that pointer j and also
increment k.

52
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,050
Now there's two E's, equal we always take
the first.

53
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,570
So the one on the left array goes to k's
position.

54
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,200
And now we increment i and k.

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,300
And again, it's an E and they're equal.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,120
We'll take the first one so we move that
one up increment i and k.

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,034
And now

58
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:44,020
j's E is smaller than g.

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,860
It's the next thing that has to go in the
output.

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,510
So we move that one up and increment j and
k.

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,770
Now the one pointed to my i, the G

62
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,480
is smallest so move that and increment i
and k.

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,040
Move the M up and increment i and k.
Now the last element in the left sub array

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,310
is the one that's going to get moved next.
And now

65
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,790
that first subarray is exhausted so really
all we need to do is take

66
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,120
the rest of the elements from the right
part and move them back in.

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Actually since we copied, we could
optimize by avoiding these moves.

68
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,860
That's an abstract in-place merge for
taking the two sorted sub-halves

69
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,660
of an array using an auxiliary array, move
them out, and

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,450
then put them back in in sorted order.
Alright, so here's the

71
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,650
code for merging, which is quite
straightforward from the demo.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,290
We first in order to sort an array of

73
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,610
comparables in this implementation we pass
a link to

74
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,840
the auxiliary array, in as well.
And we have three arguments

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,410
lo, mid, and hi.

76
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,840
So lo is the first part of the array to be
sorted.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,350
Mid's the midpoint that divides the first

78
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,320
part from the second, so our conditions
are

79
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,830
that from lo to mid is sorted, and from
mid plus 1 to hi is sorted.

80
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:17,278
[COUGH] so the merge implementation then,
the first thing

81
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:20,600
it does is copy everything over to the
auxiliary array.

82
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,220
And then that sets up for

83
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,470
this four loop that accomplishes the
merge.

84
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,970
We start our I pointer at the left heart
on the left half.

85
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,430
The J pointer on the left part of the
right half.

86
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,480
That's mid plus one.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,690
And we start the k Pointer at the
beginning lo.

88
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,000
And for every value of k what we're most

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,400
often doing is comparing whether aux of j
is less than aux

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,900
of i.

91
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,730
And if it is, we move the element of j
over in increment j.

92
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,490
If it's greater we move the element i over
in increment i.

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,690
And then in both cases, we increment a,

94
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,910
not imple, increment k, and that
implements the merge.

95
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,250
If the i pointer is exhausted, then we
just move over the j, next jth element.

96
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,650
If the j pointer is exhausted

97
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,680
we move over the next ith element.
So every time we're moving

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,790
a new element into k and that's the code
that impelements the

99
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,812
abstract in place merge.
Now with this code,

100
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:33,896
we're also introducing the idea of making
assertions just to make it

101
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:38,900
easier to debug our code and to have
confidence that it's correct.

102
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,410
In this case, this insertion just says we
want to

103
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,710
be sure that a of lo to mid assorted and
that mid plus

104
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,050
one to high is sorted before our code and
then we

105
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,580
want to check that, the whole thing is
sorted after our code.

106
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:05,664
And generally programmers, Java
programmers know that it's a good idea to

107
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,766
try to do these assertions.

108
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:11,112
Not only does it help detect bugs, but it

109
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,880
also documents what the code is supposed
to do.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,190
And that merge code is a good example of
this.

111
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,052
If you put at the beginning of the code
what you expect

112
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:24,180
in the, in the form of an assertion, which
is code itself.

113
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,730
And you put at the end of the code what
you

114
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,820
think it's going to do, again in the form
of an assertion.

115
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,010
You're both testing that these conditions

116
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,150
hold, and also telling someone reading the
code, what you're trying to do with it.

117
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,990
So Java is just an assert statement.
It takes it, boolean condition.

118
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,830
In this case, we're using that method is
sorted that we were before.

119
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,880
That returns true if the ported is sorted
and false if it's not.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,280
And what assert will do is it will throw
an exception

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,850
unless that condition is true.

122
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,852
Now the thing about assertions in Java is

123
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,250
that you can enable or disable them at
runtime.

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,850
And that's really important, because it
means you can

125
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,550
put them into your code to check while
developing.

126
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,870
But it doesn't incur any extra cost at all
in production code.

127
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,310
So by default, insertions are disabled.

128
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,480
Something goes wrong

129
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,830
somebody analyzing the situation can
enable insertions and they

130
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,960
often will help find out where, what the
problem is.

131
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,980
So, the best practice is to use insertions
just as we did in that

132
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,870
example with merge and to assume that

133
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,010
they're not going to be there in
production codes.

134
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,240
You shouldn't use them for the things like
checking

135
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,825
if the input is the way you like it.

136
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,990
Alright, so with that merge
implementation, then

137
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,020
the sort implementation is a quite simple,
recursive procedure shown here.

138
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,390
So we use the merge procedure we just
showed, and then our sort procedure.

139
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,250
It's recursive so, checks that we have
something to do first.

140
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,960
Then it computes the value of the midpoint
same way as we did

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,990
for a binary search.
Sort the first half.

142
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,810
Sort the second half, and then merge them
together.

143
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,080
And then the actual sort is takes just the
one argument

144
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,370
of the array creates the auxiliary array
and then uses that.

145
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,300
Now, it's important to not create the
auxiliary array in the re in

146
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,840
the recursive routine because that could
lead

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,460
to extensive cost of extra array creation.

148
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,720
And you'll sometimes see Mergesort
performing poorly because of that bug.

149
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,170
Otherwise this is a very straight forward
implementation.

150
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,890
And it's actually a prototype for
algorithm design

151
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,510
that we'll see come up again and again.

152
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,450
It's called divide and conquer.

153
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,460
Solve a problem

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,370
by dividing it into two halves, solving
the two halves,

155
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,420
and then putting the solutions together to
get the appropriate answer.

156
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:15,450
[COUGH] here's a trace of what Mergesort
does and if you haven't studied a

157
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:22,590
recursive program before it's worthwhile
studying this thing in, in some detail.

158
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,550
This gives exactly what happens during
each of the calls to merge.

159
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,740
We start out with a big problem to solve
but we divide it in half,

160
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,660
then we divide that one in half, and then
we divide that one in half.

161
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,710
And the very first thing

162
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,110
that we actually do is just compare

163
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,150
and exchange if necessary the first two
elements.

164
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,960
And then we do the same thing for the next
two elements.

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,040
Then merge those two together to get the
first four done.

166
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,300
And then we do the same thing for the next
four in the array.

167
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,790
So now we have two sorted sub-arrays at
size four.

168
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,330
And we merge those together to get one of
size eight.

169
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,840
And then we do the same thing on the
right,

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,890
and eventually we have two eights that we
merge together

171
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,250
to get the final result.

172
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,110
Very instructive to study this trace to

173
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,850
really understand what this recursive
algorithm is doing.

174
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,080
So now we can animate and again
Mergesort's more

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,149
efficient, so we can do more and more
items.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,820
You can see it's got the first half

177
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,040
sorted, now it's working on the second
half.

178
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,100
And then once it gets the second half
sorted,

179
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,430
then it's going to go ahead and merge them
right together to get the sorted result.

180
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,490
It's got a little extra [COUGH] dynamics

181
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,319
in the animation because of the auxiliary
array.

182
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,010
Let's look at it when it's in reverse
order

183
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,590
again it gets the first half done now it's
working on the second half once

184
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,100
it gets the second half done then it goes
ahead and merges together the whole thing

185
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,180
it's just as fast in reverse order as as
in auditory order.

186
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,210
So you can run a Mergesort on huge
problems.

187
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,520
It's a very efficient algorithm.
And so, for example,

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,140
what this table shows, if you were to try
to use a insertion sort for a huge

189
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,660
file, say a file with a billion elements,
on

190
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,770
your PC it'd take a few centuries to
finish.

191
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,300
Even on a super computer, if you're using
insertion

192
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,380
sort nowadays it'd maybe take a week or
more.

193
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,150
But if you have a good algorithm like

194
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,540
Mergesort, and you're trying to do a
billion items,

195
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,150
you can do it in just less than half an
hour on your PC.

196
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,880
And a supercomputer can do it in an
instant.

197
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,150
And smaller problems only take an instant
even on your PC.

198
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:52,890
So you can spend a lot of money or a lot
of time, or you can use a good algorithm.

199
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,750
And that's one of our main themes in this
course.

200
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,770
A good algorithm is much more effective
than spending

201
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,990
money or time wasting money or time using
a bad one.

202
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,950
So let's look at the analysis of
Mergesort, that's a bit of math but very

203
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:21,040
instructive because this really shows the
power of the divide and conquer method.

204
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,900
And allow us to take a problem that was
taking us quadratic time with methods

205
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,200
like insertion and selection sort, and get
it done in, in log N time with Mergesort.

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,000
So that's the proposition Mergesort uses
at most N lg N

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,050
compares and 6 N lg N array accesses to
sort any array of size N.

208
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,190
And the way to prove this proposition is
to from

209
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,900
examining the code, to write down what's
called a recurrence relation.

210
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,140
And all that is, it's a mathematical
reflection of what's going on in the code.

211
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,220
If we're sorting N items then let C of N
denote

212
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,610
the number of compares that we need to
sort the N items.

213
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,740
In order to get that done, we're sorting
the left half and the right half and

214
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,100
this notation ceiling of N over 2 and
floor of N over 2 that's the N over

215
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,450
2 round up and N over 2 round down, that's
the size of the two sub-arrays, and

216
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,410
we're going to call the same routine for
that

217
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,460
size, so the number of compares you need
to.

218
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,060
For that is C of N over 2, ceiling of N
over 2

219
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,737
for the left and ceiling of, floor of N
over 2 for the right.

220
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:40,450
And then for the merge, we need at least,
at most N compares.

221
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,940
If neither one exhausts, we need exactly N
compares.

222
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,300
And so and that's true as long as N is
bigger than 1.

223
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,530
If there's only one thing, we're not

224
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,580
doing any compares at all.
So this is a mathematical formula that we

225
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,830
derive by examining the code but it
completely describes mathematically

226
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,200
what we an upper bound on the number of
compares that are going to be needed.

227
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,170
And similarly for the number of array
accesses, if you count up the number of

228
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,930
times you're accessing an array for a
merge you could be at most six in.

229
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
So these are mathematical formulas and
there's techniques

230
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,240
for solving them and we won't go into
that.

231
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,610
This is not a course on discrete
mathematics.

232
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,820
But what we then do is show how to solve
the recurrence when N is a power of 2.

233
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,530
And then it turns out that it holds for
all

234
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,090
N, which we can prove by induction from
the recurrence.

235
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,040
So if you have this recurrence [COUGH]
which

236
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,540
is similar to the ones that we're talking
about.

237
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,840
It's exactly the same when N is a power of
2 let's, let's look at this one.

238
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,010
If

239
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:00,520
D of N is 2D of N over 2 plus N with D of
1 equals 0, then D of N equals N log N.

240
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,800
We'll look at three proofs of that, just
assuming that N is a power of 2.

241
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,140
If N is a power of 2, then N over 2

242
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,350
is also a power of two, so the recurrence
makes sense.

243
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,310
So this is just a graphical representation
if we

244
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,140
want to compute D of N we want to compute
D

245
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,470
of N over 2 twice.
So that's 2 and then the extra cost

246
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,285
for the merge is N, but if we're going to
do this twice then we have 2N over 2.

247
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:34,590
So let's, we have 2N over 2s and then for

248
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,110
each one of these we have divided into N
over

249
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,130
4s and each one of those 4N over 4s has an
extra cross for the merge of N over 4.

250
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,980
Well 2N over 2 is N, 4N over 4 is N and we
keep going down, doing that til

251
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,660
we get down to D of 2 and we always for
the extra cross for the merge, we have N.

252
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,940
And how many stages do we have here?

253
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,740
Well, it's the number of times you divide
N by 2 to get down to 2.

254
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,630
That's exactly log base 2 of N, so the
grand total of

255
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,220
all the costs for the merge, which is
where the compares are,

256
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,950
is log N times N, N log N.
It's kind of a graphical

257
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,550
proof or a proof by picture that that
recurrence has that solution.

258
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,110
Here's a little bit more mathematical one:
we write the recurrence down,

259
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,880
and then we divide both sides by N.

260
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,640
So then this is D of N over N equals D of
N over 2 over N over 2 plus 1.

261
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
So it's dividing by N.

262
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,670
So now, this is a recurrence that
telescopes.

263
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,780
The first term on the right hand side is
exactly the same

264
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,710
as the left hand side so we can apply the
same formula.

265
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,140
And all it does is divides by 2 again and
then throws out another 1.

266
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,570
And we keep doing that until

267
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,450
we get down to D of 1 which is 0.

268
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,990
And when we've done that, we've thrown out
lg N 1s.

269
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,510
So we get D of N over N equals log N, or D
of N equals N log N.

270
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,560
That's another proof by expansion.

271
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,560
Or using either one of those techniques
you could just get the idea that D of N is

272
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:28,890
close to Log N or you can write a program
to expand the recurrence and find that.

273
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,130
And then once we have the idea that D of N

274
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,700
equals N lg N, we can plug back into the
original formula.

275
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,100
With the inductive hypothesis that D of N
equals

276
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,395
N lg N, we want to show that D of 2N

277
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:52,210
equals 2N lg 2N, using the recurrence D of
2N equals 2D of N plus throw out the 2N.

278
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,290
Plugging in N log N we get the desired
result.

279
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,190
We use this same idea on our initial
recurrences

280
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,770
for comparison array accesses to show that
the running,

281
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,030
the number of comparison array accesses is
proportional to N log N for Mergesort.

282
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,365
So that's the running time Mergesort is
fast

283
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:18,370
other thing that we usually want to know
is memory.

284
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,060
And one of Mergesort's characteristics is
that in

285
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,810
practical applications, it uses extra
space proportional to N.

286
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,550
That is, we need that extra auxiliary
array for the last merge.

287
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,510
We took two sorted subarrays and we talked
about an abstract

288
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,610
in place merge but we didn't have an
actual in place merge.

289
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,410
We were using an extra subarray.

290
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,846
So N place is important.

291
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,630
A lot of times, we're sorting everything
we have.

292
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,590
We want to fill up the memory with stuff
to sort and then sort it.

293
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,380
And search and selection in shellsort are
in place, they don't use any extra memory.

294
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,500
But Mergesort you can only sort really
half of what you can

295
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,920
fit in memory, because you need that
auxiliary array for the other half.

296
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,910
If you want, again, if you think that the
things we're studying

297
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,800
are easy, think about the idea of actually
doing an in-place merge.

298
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,530
People have come up with methods for
getting this done.

299
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,420
So it's theoretically possible, but the
methods are

300
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,980
generally too complex to be useful in
practice and

301
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,310
their not used.

302
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,060
But there could be out there some easy way
to doing in place merge.

303
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,500
That's another great algorithm waiting to
be discovered.

304
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,480
Now there's a, a number of practical
improvements that we can

305
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,690
use to make Mergesort even more efficient
than the simple one

306
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,930
that we've looked at and we'll take a look
of those

307
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:48,150
because they're examples of techniques
that we can use for other algorithms.

308
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,640
First thing is that Mergesort is too
complicated to use for tiny arrays.

309
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,880
So say the subarrays are only of two, or
three, or four there's too

310
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,950
much overhead with the recursive calls and
so forth to get that done efficiently.

311
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,660
And what's worse is, the recursive nature
of the sort definitely

312
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,480
means that there's going to be lots of
subarrays to be sorted.

313
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,290
So, one improvement that we can make is to
use insertion sort, and just

314
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,510
cut off and use insertion sort which is
simple and efficient for small subarrays.

315
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,790
So that's adding this one line of code to
Mergesort will make it quite a bit faster.

316
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,490
Maybe 20% faster.

317
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,330
The second improvement that we can make
that'll improve the performance

318
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,520
for cases when the array is partly sorted,
is to just

319
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,950
stop if it's already sorted.

320
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,120
And that's going to happen in the case
where the biggest element in the

321
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,190
first half is less or equal to the
smallest item in the second half.

322
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,990
That means it's done.

323
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,080
So that's easy.

324
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,860
We just put a test in the recursive
Mergesort for that,

325
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,880
through this one line of code, to check
whether we're done.

326
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,160
That way, for example, if you were to call

327
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,560
Mergesort for an array that's already in
order it would

328
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,880
just do this test every time and it would
be done in linear time.

329
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,520
That's pretty helpful although not, not
totally helpful

330
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,490
but there's a lot of situations where
that's helpful.

331
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,470
The other thing that's possible to do and
it's a little mind bending so recommended

332
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,370
only for experts.
Is to save a

333
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,320
little bit of time you don't really have
to copy over into the auxiliary array.

334
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,650
You can kind of switch the role of the
input

335
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,520
and the auxiliary array every time you
make a recursive call.

336
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,120
You still need that array but

337
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,160
you can set up the code in this way which
[COUGH]

338
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,240
sort, to sort an array, put the result in
the other one.

339
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,240
To merge an array, put the result back in
the first one.

340
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,930
So it's recursive argument switchery to
get the job done.

341
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,490
And it's effective, it means you don't
have to actually

342
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,890
move items, and that saves a little bit of
time.

343
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,630
So here's a visualization

344
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,110
of what the practical Mergesort might look
like, and this is with

345
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,770
big cutoff to small subfiles.
So you

346
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,360
got a visual feeling of how this sort gets
the job done.

347
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,828
So it's the first little chunck and then
the next little

348
00:23:28,828 --> 00:23:32,429
chunk and then merges those together, and
so forth and so on.

349
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:34,765
It's a good visual representation of

350
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:40,577
how Mergesort gets its job done.
That's the basic Mergesort algorithm

351
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:45,650
that we're going to look at different
versions of in the next.
