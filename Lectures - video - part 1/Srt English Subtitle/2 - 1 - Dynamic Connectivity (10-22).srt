00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,085
Welcome back to algorithms. Today, we're
going to talk about the union find

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:09,098
problem. A set of algorithms for solving
the so-called dynamic connectivity

3
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:14,091
problem. We'll look at two classic
algorithms. Quick Find and Quick Union,

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:20,078
and some applications and improvements of
those algorithms. The subtext of today's

5
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:27,039
lecture really is to go through the steps
that we'll follow over and over again to

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,039
develop a useful algorithm. The first step
is to model the problem. Try to

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,031
understand, basically, what are the main
elements of the problem that need to be

8
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:41,681
solved. Then we'll find some algorithm to
solve the problem. In many cases, the

9
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:46,486
first algorithm we come up with would be
fast enough and maybe it fits in memory

10
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:52,024
and, we'll go ahead and use it, and be off
and running. But in many other cases maybe

11
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:56,074
it's not fast enough, or there's not
enough memory. So, what we do is try to

12
00:00:56,074 --> 00:01:01,037
figure out why, find a way to address
whatever's causing that problem, find a

13
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:06,051
new algorithm and iterate until we're
satisfied. This is the scientific approach

14
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:11,099
to designing and analyzing algorithms,
where we build mathematical models to try

15
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,061
and understand what's going on, and then
we do experiments to validate those models

16
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:22,089
and help us improve things. So, first
we'll talk about the dynamic connectivity

17
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:29,021
problem, the model of the problem for
union find. So, here's the idea. They're

18
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:33,090
going to have a set of N objects. Doesn't
really matter what they are. We're going

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,002
to use the numbers, zero through N to
model our objects. And then, we have the

20
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:43,082
idea of a connection between two objects.
And, we'll, postulate that there's going

21
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:48,057
to be a command that says, connect two
objects. Given two objects, provide a

22
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:53,093
connection between them. And then key part
of the problem is find query or the

23
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:59,097
connected query, which just asks, is there
a path connecting the two objects. So for

24
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:05,021
example, in this set of ten objects, we
performed already, a bunch of union

25
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:10,278
commands, connecting four and three, three
and eight, six and five, nine and four,

26
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:16,526
two and one. And now we might have a
connected query that says, is zero connect

27
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:22,713
ed to seven? Well, in this case, there is
no connection, so we say no. But if we ask

28
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:28,281
is eight connected to nine? We are going
to say yes, even no we don't have a direct

29
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:33,629
connection between eight and nine. There
is a path from eight to three to four to

30
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,783
nine. So, that's our problem, to be able
to officially support these two commands

31
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:45,444
for given set of objects. Now, let's say
we add a union five, zero. So, that

32
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:51,026
creates a connection between five and
zero. Seven and two creates a connection

33
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:56,744
between seven and two. And six and one,
between six and one. So, now if we ask our

34
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:02,836
zero connected to seven, well one and zero
we can do that too. And that's a redundant

35
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:08,528
connection. And now, if we ask is zero
connected to seven we're going to answer

36
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:13,858
yes. So that's our problem, intermix
union, commands and connected queries and

37
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:18,991
we need to be able to officially support
those commands for a large number of

38
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:23,833
objects. So, here's a much bigger example.
And you can see that we're going to need

39
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,128
efficient algorithms for this. First of
all, you can see we're going to need a

40
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,085
computer for this. It would take quite,
quite some time for a human to figure out

41
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:38,205
whether there's a connection. In this case
there is a connection. Now, the algorithms

42
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:43,805
that we're looking at today are not going
to actually give the path connecting the

43
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:48,847
two objects. It's just going to be able to
answer the question, is there a path? In

44
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:53,721
part two of the course, we'll consider
algorithms that explicitly find paths.

45
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:59,220
They're not as efficient as union find
because they have more work to do. Now,

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,972
applications of these, these algorithms
involve objects of all types. These are

47
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:11,906
used for digital photos, where the objects
are pixels they're used for networks,

48
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:17,444
where the objects are computers, social
networks, where it's people, or computer

49
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:23,528
chips, where it's circuit elements or
abstract things like variable names in a

50
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:29,334
program, or elements in a mathematical
set, or physical things like metallic

51
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:34,802
sites in a composite system. So, all
different types of objects for, but for

52
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:40,574
programming we're going to associate each
object with a name and we'll just name the

53
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:46,810
objects with a number, integers from zero
to N-1. That's a very convenient initial

54
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,605
starting point for our programs because we
can use integers as an index into an array

55
00:04:53,605 --> 00:05:00,160
then, and then quickly access information
relevant to each object. And it also just

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,777
supresses a lot of details that are not
relevant to union find. In fact, to make

57
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:10,444
this mapping from an object name to the
integer zero through N - one is to find

58
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,914
application of a symbol table or a
searching algorithm, which is one of the

59
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:20,300
things that we'll be studying later in
this course algorithms and data structures

60
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:26,316
for solving that problem. Now, the
connections, well, we need, a few abstract

61
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:33,545
properties that these connections have to
satisfy. And they're all quite natural and

62
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:40,563
intuitive. So we assume that is connected
to is an equivalence relation. That is,

63
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:47,148
every object's connected to itself, it's
symmetric. If P's connected to Q, then Q's

64
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:53,205
connected to P, and it's transitive. If
P's connected to Q, and Q's connected to

65
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:59,128
R, then P's connected to R. Now these
properties are very intuitive. But it's

66
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:05,292
worthwhile to state them explicitly and
make sure that our algorithms maintain

67
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:12,452
them. When we have an equivalence relation
a set of objects and connections divide

68
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:19,172
into subsets called connected components.
A connected component is a maximal set of

69
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:25,056
objects that's mutually connected. For
example in this small example here,

70
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:30,936
there's three connected components. One
consisting of just object zero, second one

71
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:36,239
objects one, four and five. And third one
the other four objects. And these

72
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:42,244
components have the property that if any
two objects in them are connected and

73
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:47,096
there is no object outside that is
connected to those objects, that's

74
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:53,126
connected components. Our algorithms will
gain efficiency by maintaining connected

75
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:59,319
components and using that knowledge to
efficiently answer the query that's, that

76
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,949
they're presented with. Okay, so to
implement the operations, we have to find

77
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,840
query and the union command. And so we're
going to mai ntain the connected

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,449
components. The find is going to have to
check if two objects are in the same

79
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,243
component and the union command is going
to have to replace components containing

80
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:25,872
two objects with their union. So, for
example, if we have these components, and

81
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:31,906
we get the command to union connect, two
and five. Essentially, we need to merge

82
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:37,965
the connected components containing the
one containing two or the one containing

83
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:44,453
five to get a big connected components and
now we have only two connected components.

84
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:52,821
All of that leads up to, in a programming
world to specifying, a data type which is

85
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:59,122
simply specification of the methods that
we are want to going to implement in order

86
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:04,980
to solve this problem. So you know,
typical Java model, what we will do is

87
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:12,425
create a class called UF that contains two
methods, one to implement union, the other

88
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:19,052
one to implement connected, which returns
a boolean. The constructor, takes SR unit,

89
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:26,030
the number of objects, so that it can
build data structure based on the number

90
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,089
of objects. So, and we have to, bear in
mind, as we're building our logarithms,

91
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,029
that both the number of objects can be
huge, but also, the number of operations.

92
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,076
We can have a, a very large number, of
union and connected, operations and our

93
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:48,315
algorithms are going to have to be
efficient, under those conditions. One of

94
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:56,011
the practices that will follow often in
this course is to check our API design

95
00:08:56,011 --> 00:09:04,029
before getting too far into dealing with
the problem, by building a client that is

96
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:11,050
going to use the data type that we
develop. So, for this example, we've got a

97
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:19,074
client that, Will read information from
standard input. First, an integer which is

98
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:27,381
the number of objects that are going to be
processed. And then a series of pairs of

99
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:35,070
object names. And what the client does is
it, it'll, first it'll read the integer

100
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:42,068
from standard input, and create a, a UF
object. And then as long as standard input

101
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:47,089
is not empty, it's going to read two
integers from the input. And if they're

102
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:52,663
not connected, then it'll connect them and
print them out. If they are connected

103
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:58,266
it'll ignore. So, that's our test client
and that's a fine test client to make sure

104
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:04,702
that any implementation does what we
expect that it will. So, that's the setup.

105
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:10,348
We've described the operations we want to
implement all the way down to code and we

106
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:15,091
have client code that we're going to have
to be able to service with our
