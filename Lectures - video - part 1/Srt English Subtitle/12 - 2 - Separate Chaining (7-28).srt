1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,060
Next we'll look at separate chaining, a
collision red solution strategy that makes

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:13,008
use of elementary link list. So, what are
we supposed to do when two different keys

3
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:18,011
hash to the same index? The birthday
problem tells us that we're going to have

4
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:23,259
collisions. You need a quadratic amount of
memory to avoid collisions. In the lower

5
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,617
balancing, a coupon collector analysis
tell us that the collisions are going to

6
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:32,497
be evenly distribute, distributed among
the table, around the table. So, what we

7
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:37,380
want to do is have an easy way to deal
with collisions. And so the first way

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,414
we'll look at is called Separate Chaining
and it's a very diagonal idea back1953,

9
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:48,881
and the idea is just build a link list for
each of the table positions. So, we'll

10
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:53,667
have a table that's smaller than the
number of keys that we have, the hash

11
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:58,437
function will map each key to some
integer. So in this case, we have a table

12
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:03,779
of size five. So the hash function will
map any key. In this case, we use single

13
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:09,927
letter keys. It'll map any key to an
integer between zero and four and then to

14
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:16,286
[cough] do an insertion we'll just keep a
link list at the table position

15
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:22,296
corresponding to the hash value. So S hash
is to position two, it'll be on the link

16
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:28,198
list that is first link is at position
two. And E goes to zero, and A goes to

17
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:34,008
zero. And for search, we're going to have
to go to, if we're going to look at is C

18
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:40,046
in this table say, we're going to find the
hash value for C and we'll look down the

19
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:45,431
list to see if we can find C. So we have
to look through the whole list for search

20
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:49,976
but you only have to look through one list
out of all the lists. Essentially if you

21
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:55,206
have M entries in the hash table and M
keys the link of list you're going to look

22
00:01:55,206 --> 00:02:01,502
at is about N over M cuz they're evenly
distributed. So that's a straightforward

23
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:08,555
and simple scheme for implementing symbol
tables with hashing. Now, we could use a

24
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:15,991
interval bag or some data structure like
that and hide the link list structure

25
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:22,386
underneath and that's a perfectly fine way
to proceed in modern programming. This

26
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:29,303
implementation directly implements the
link list. Now, for a practical situation

27
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:36,890
we picked some kind of, some value of M.
You could make it so that the hash table

28
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,882
itself grows once it gets really huge and
such hybrid methods are easy to implement.

29
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:52,106
So we won't talk to much about that. We
need to just in terms of implementation

30
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:59,064
details, our keys and values have to be
objects. Because we can't have an array of

31
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:06,334
generics. So, since we're making array of
nodes, a node would have generics if we

32
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:14,225
use to key in value. So we have to make
them objects then when we get things off,

33
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:22,987
we're going to have cast. So [cough] this
is the get procedure. So to look for a key

34
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:30,589
in the hash table we compute the hash
value. In our hash function is pull out

35
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:37,170
the system hash code, make it positive by
ending off the sign bit and then mark with

36
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:43,993
M to get a number of, zero and -one. So we
pick that number, I and then we just go to

37
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:50,287
that list and this is the standard code
for diversing a link list start at the

38
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:57,485
first node as long as it is not null go x
= x dot x. And if you find a key that's

39
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:02,655
equal to the key you're looking for,
return the value and we have to cast it to

40
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:08,452
value because of the generic recreation
problem in Java, otherwise return null. So

41
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:14,448
that's not much code, and it's trivial
code at that for doing an efficient symbol

42
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:21,075
table search using hashing. And insertion
is not much more difficult if you do the

43
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:27,414
same thing and if you find a node where
key equal to key on the link list, reset

44
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:35,089
the value and return. Otherwise, you make
a new node and put it at the beginning of

45
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:43,218
the link list with the standard code. Now,
replace STFI with a new node that links to

46
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:49,820
the old STFI. So again, very little code
to implement search and insert using

47
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,071
hashin g and that's why it's so popular.
And what about the analysis? Well, again

48
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:04,304
this the [cough] standard probabilistic
analysis of the balls and bins problem

49
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:12,035
tells us a lot of information of what goes
on. And again, if the uniform hashing

50
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:18,173
assumption holds the probability that the
number of keys within a list is within a

51
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:24,006
constant factor of N over M is extremely
close to one. So, it means that we've

52
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:30,065
divided the search cost which would be N
if we have a sequential search by a factor

53
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:37,005
of M. And, and in many applications even
setting M = 100 or 1,000 is going to be

54
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:44,239
very effective. And that's why so many
system programs refuse that. So, number of

55
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:51,935
pros for search and insert's proportional
to N over M. Now typically, what we'd what

56
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:58,038
a programmer would do is try to figure on
making M about equal to the number of keys

57
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,071
divided by five say. So, you can't make M
too large, you have too much space and

58
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:08,609
you'll have empty chains or short chains.
And if you make M too small then they're

59
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:13,739
too long, you have to search through them
all. So let's say, N over five and then

60
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:19,995
you get constant time searches and not
much extra space. You have extra space for

61
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:25,244
the links to implement the link lists but
the rest of the table is not much extra

62
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:30,155
space. And those are typical parameters.
If you want a full service symbol table

63
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:34,404
which is going to, going to grow from
small to huge and then back down to small

64
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:39,588
again then you'd want to use array
re-sizing to make sure that M is always

65
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:45,879
within a constant factor of N but we will
leave that detail out for now. So that

66
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,264
brings us to this summary where red-black
trees, we were happy with a log based two

67
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:56,791
of N for search and insert with separate
chaining, you can really get it down to a

68
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:02,084
constant number of operations for search
and insert. So hashing's going to be

69
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:08,193
preferred for short keys where the hash
function's easy to compute. And where we

70
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:13,737
don't need ordered iteration or any of the
ordered symbol table operations because it

71
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:20,726
has really fast access to the symbol
table. That's our first collision

72
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:29,042
resolution method, hashing with separate
chaining.
