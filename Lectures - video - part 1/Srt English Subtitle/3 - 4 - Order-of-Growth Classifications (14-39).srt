1
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:08,071
Now, fortunately when we analyze
algorithms, actually not too many

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:14,746
different functions arise and actually
that property allows us to really classify

3
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:20,978
algorithms according to their performance
as the problem size grows. So that's what

4
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:27,173
we'll talk about next. So the good news is
there's only these few functions turn up

5
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:31,915
about the algorithms that we are
interested in. We can craft things that

6
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:37,479
have other functions and there are counter
examples to this. But really a great

7
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:43,394
number of the algorithms that we consider
are described by these few functions and

8
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:50,362
that are plotted here. And [cough] the
when we are talking about the order of

9
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:55,793
growth, we are not talking about the
leading constant. Normally we'll say the

10
00:00:55,793 --> 00:01:00,971
running time of the algorithm is
proportional to N log N. That means we

11
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:06,686
that we think that our hypothesis is that
the running time is tilde C lg N, N lg N,

12
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:12,671
where C is some constant. And in these
plots, these are lg, lg plots that not

13
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:18,801
really give a good idea of what's going
on. If a order of growth is logarithmic or

14
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:25,026
constant, doesn't matter how big the thing
is. It's going to be fast of the running

15
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:32,082
time for is T for say a thousand, and for
half a million it will be pretty close to

16
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:38,674
T. If it's linear, if it's auto growth is
proportional to N then as the running

17
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:44,945
time, as the size increases the running
time increases correspondingly. And the

18
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:51,031
same is true, almost, if it's N log N. So
those are the algorithms that we strive

19
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:56,755
for. They scale with the input size. As
the input grows, so grows the running

20
00:01:56,755 --> 00:02:02,647
time. And that's, a reasonable situation
to be in. As we talked about when we

21
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:07,843
talked about Union-find. If it's
quadratic, the running time grows much

22
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:13,469
faster than the input size. And it's not
feasible to use such an algorithm for

23
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:21,397
large inputs. And qubic is even worse. So
what we find is for many algorithms our

24
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:28,515
first task is really, simply, make sure
it's not quadratic or qubit. And these

25
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:35,708
order of growth classifications actually
come from kind of simple patterns in terms

26
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:41,918
of the code that we write. So if our code
has no loops in it, then the order of

27
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:49,033
growth is going to be constant. If our
code has some kind of loop where the

28
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:54,276
input's divided in half, and so binary
search algorithm is an example of that.

29
00:02:54,276 --> 00:03:00,676
Then our order growth will be logarithmic
and we'll take a look at that analysis and

30
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:06,879
but if you do the doubling test, it grows
almost linearly, if you have a huge input

31
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,633
and you double the size it's, it's still
going to be I'm sorry, not linearly,

32
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:18,252
constant just like if it's constant.
You'll hardly notice that lg N. If you

33
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:25,070
have a loop where you touch everything in
your input. Than the running time is

34
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,592
linear, proportional to end so a typical
example of that would be find the maximum,

35
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:38,205
or to count the number of zeros. Our one
some problem. A very interesting category

36
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:44,681
is a so-called N lg N algorithms or linear
rhythmic algorithms. And those are the

37
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:50,143
ones that arise from a particular
algorithms design technique called the

38
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:55,573
divide and conquer. And the Mergesort
algorithm, which we'll talk about in a

39
00:03:55,573 --> 00:04:01,012
couple of weeks, is a prime example of
that. And then if you have double four

40
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:07,543
loops like our two sum algorithm, that's
going to be time proportional to N^2. As

41
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:13,530
we saw, that's quadratic, or triple four
loop like our 3-sum algorithm, that's

42
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,369
going to be cubic or time proportional to
N^3. For a quadratic algorithm or a cubic

43
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:25,312
algorithm, the doubling factor is four or
eight as the input size double for cubic

44
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:30,331
algorithm, the running time goes up by a
factor of eight, and that's the kind of

45
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:35,952
calculation that you can do in your head
while waiting for a program to finish.

46
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:41,645
There's also a category of algorithms
who's running time is exponential and in

47
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:47,059
those algorithms n doesn't get very large
at and we'll talk about those at the end

48
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:53,150
part two of the course. So these are some
practical implications of, of the order

49
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,352
growth. And we really dwell on this too
much, except to come back to the point

50
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:04,723
that the algorithms we are really
interested in, that can solve huge

51
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:11,633
problems, are the linear and N lg N
algorithms. Because even now a quadr atic

52
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:17,913
algorithm on a typical fast computer could
only solve problems and saying that tens

53
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:23,246
of thousands in a cubic algorithm only in
the size of thousands. And nowadays those

54
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:28,567
are just not useful because the amount of
data that we have is more like the

55
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:34,689
millions or billions or trillions. That
fact is becoming more and more evident as

56
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:41,269
time wears on the ancient times would have
some discussion about whether quadratic

57
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:47,154
algorithm might be useful but the
situation gets worse as the time goes on,

58
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:52,593
so we need better algorithms. To
illustrate the process of developing a

59
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:57,756
mathematical model for describing a
performance through an algorithm, we'll

60
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:03,037
look at a familiar algorithm called binary
search. It's, the goal is that you have a

61
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:08,323
sorted array of integers, say and you're
given a key. And you want to know, is that

62
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:13,321
key in the array? And if it is, what,
what's its index? And a fast algorithm for

63
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:18,178
doing this is known as binary search,
where we compare the key against the

64
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:22,941
middle entry. In this case, if we're
looking for 33, we compare it against 53.

65
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,737
If its smaller we know its in the left
half of the array, if it's larger we know

66
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:32,819
it's in the right half of the array, if
it's equal, we found it. And then we apply

67
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:39,680
the same algorithm recursively. So let's
quickly look at a demo. So we're looking

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,777
for 33 in this array, compare it against
the middle entry in the array. 53 and it's

69
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:51,160
less so we go left, so now we can
concentrate just on the left half of the

70
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,788
array, now we look in the middle of this
half, that's 25, 33 is bigger so we go

71
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:02,399
right. And now we concentrate on the right
half or the left half and we have a

72
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,690
smaller sub array. Look at the middle, 33
is less so we go left and now we have only

73
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:15,019
the one element to look at and we found
our key 33 in the array and we return that

74
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,234
index four. If we're looking for something
that's not in the array, we do the same

75
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:26,874
process. So, say, we're looking for 34.
It's going to be the same. Look in the

76
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:32,923
left half, look in the right half. Look to
the left of the 43. Now, there's only one

77
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:39,478
key to look at. A nd it's not 34, so we
say, it's not there. So that's binary

78
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:47,488
search. So here's the code for binary
search. Actually, Binary Search although

79
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:53,391
it's a simple algorithm, its notoriously
tricky to get every detail right. In fact

80
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:58,827
one paper claimed, that the first bug free
binary search wasn't published until 1962,

81
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:04,430
and even in 2006, a bug was found in
Java's implementation of binary search,

82
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,417
just an indication of the care that we
have to take in developing algorithms

83
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:15,847
especially for libraries that are going to
be used by millions of people. So here's

84
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:24,048
an implementation. It's not recursive
although often we can implement this

85
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:32,050
recursively. And it's just reflexing code,
what I described in words, we have to

86
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:41,029
find. A key, whether a key's in an array.
And we use two pointers, low and high, to,

87
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,051
indicate the part of the array we are
interested in, as long as low is less and

88
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:51,053
equal to high, we compute the middle. And
then we compare our key against the

89
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:56,082
middle, actually its a three way compare,
see its less or greater or if its equal,

90
00:08:56,082 --> 00:09:02,011
we, we return that mid index. If its less
we reset the high pointer, if its greater,

91
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:07,026
we reset the low pointer, and we keep on
going until the pointers are equal. If

92
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:12,034
they are equal and we haven't found it
then we return -one. And it's easy to

93
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:18,023
persuade ourselves that this program works
as advertised by thinking about this

94
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:24,025
invariant, if the keys in the array, then
it's between low and high in the array.

95
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:30,036
Alright, so that's a program that, you are
probably familiar with. Lets look at the

96
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:36,039
mathematical analysis of that program. And
this a, a theorem that we are going to

97
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:42,049
prove easily. We want to a lot of proofs
but this is one worth doing. So its say

98
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:48,045
that binary search uses at most one + lg
base two event compares, to complete a

99
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:55,032
search, in a sorted array of size f. So we
do that, to setup the problem by defining,

100
00:09:55,032 --> 00:10:02,089
a variable T(N), which is the number of
compares that binary search needed for its

101
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:10,001
array size and. And then we write down a
recurrence relation that is reflex the

102
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:16,076
code. And what the code does is, it
divides the problem size in half so that.

103
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:23,000
If the event is less or equal to the event
over two plus depending on how you count

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,045
what the compare is think of it as a two
way compare so divided in half by doing

105
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:35,046
one compare and that's true as long as N
is bigger than one. If it's equal to one

106
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:42,039
the solution is one. So it's a recurrent
relation describing the computation. And

107
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,094
so we, we can go ahead and, solve this
recurrence by applying the recurrence

108
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:55,882
itself, to the first term on the right.
Now that's called telescoping. So if this

109
00:10:55,882 --> 00:11:03,378
is true and we can apply the same thing to
T(N/2). And throw out another one and if

110
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:09,096
that's, this is true, apply the same thing
to N over four, and throw out another one

111
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:15,340
and so forth until we get down to just
one. In which case we have lg N ones left.

112
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,794
Now this is a true sketch you might have
noticed that, that this proof actually

113
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:29,118
only holds if N is a power of two. Because
we nearly specify in this recurrence what

114
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:36,985
we mean if N is odd. But it's possible to
go ahead and sorry, possible to go ahead

115
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:45,649
and take care of that detail as well and
show that binary search running time is

116
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:52,779
logarithmic always. All right, so given
that fact we can develop a faster

117
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,548
algorithm for a threesome. It's a sorting
based algorithm. And so what we're going

118
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:04,638
to do is we're going to take the numbers
that we have as input and sort them. We'll

119
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:11,553
talk about sorting algorithms next week.
And we get that time in time proportional

120
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:18,416
to N lg N but that's not the main part of
the computation. The main part of the

121
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:25,682
computation is to after the numbers are
sorted, we'll go through and for each pair

122
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:32,452
of numbers ai and aj. We'll do a binary
search for -ai + ij. If we find it then

123
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:41,319
we'll have three numbers that sum to zero.
So if we [cough] sort our numbers and then

124
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:48,610
go through for each pair do a binary
search to see if it's there, so -40, zero.

125
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:55,631
Minus that is 40, we do a binary search
that's in there so we have one solution to

126
00:12:55,631 --> 00:13:02,081
the 3-sum problem. And do that for all
pairs of numbers. Then a quick analysis

127
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:08,243
says the order of growth of running time
is going to be N^2 lg N. Then you need a

128
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:14,064
good sort, well, you could use the
elementary insertion sort the first one we

129
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:20,678
talk about but the running time of the
binary search for each of the pairs, each

130
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:26,712
of the N^2 pairs or N^2/2 pairs we're
going to do the binary search, so we get a

131
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:32,997
N^2 lg N running time. So, a quick example
of how we could improve the performance,

132
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:39,970
we could find an imroved algorithm to
solve a problem. N^2 lg N is much less

133
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,462
than N^3 for large N. And so, we're
implicitly making the hypothesis that if

134
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:51,872
we do this, do the sort base thing and use
binary search, we're going to have a

135
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:58,257
faster program. And, sure enough we can go
ahead and run some experiments and find

136
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:03,498
that whereas it took us 50 seconds to
solve the problem for 8,000 numbers

137
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:08,858
before. It's taking less than a second
now. In 50 seconds we can solve up to

138
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:15,118
64,000. So typically we expect that better
order of growth means. Faster in practice

139
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:21,051
and but when it comes to examining the
algorithms in detail we can, we can go

140
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:26,731
ahead and do the tests and figure out
which algorithm is faster. And certainly

141
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:31,893
going from N^3 to N^2 lg N we're going to
expect that we're going to have a much

142
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,003
better algorithm.
