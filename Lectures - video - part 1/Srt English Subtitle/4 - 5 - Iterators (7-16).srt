1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,509
Okay. There's another facility that Java
provides that leads to very elegant

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,759
compact client code that's definitely
worthwhile to add to our basic data types

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,058
and that's iteration, that's what we're
going to talk about now. So, what we want

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:23,176
to do is to allow the client to iterate
through the items in the collection. But

5
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:28,286
we don't have the client to know whether
we're using an array or link list or

6
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:34,620
whatever internal representation we might
have in mind. It's not relevant to the

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,189
client. And a lot of clients only want to
do is just iterate through the stuff in

8
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:47,304
the collection. But Java does provide a nice
a solution to this called iteration. So

9
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:53,523
what we're going to do is look at how to
make our stack, and queue, and other data

10
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:58,914
structures that we consider later on
implement the so-called Iterable interface

11
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:05,662
and it will work for client code no matter
which implementation we used so let's take

12
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:13,497
a look at the details of that. So what's
an Iterable? Well, in Java lingo what an

13
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:20,914
Iterable is, it's, it's a class that has a
method that returns an iterator. And so

14
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:29,271
what's an Iterator? Well an Iterator is
something, a class that has methods hasNext()

15
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:37,519
and next(). The Java also allows remove().
We think that one is bad news, we don't

16
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:45,861
use it can lead to insidious debug, bug
debugging problems. So, it's hasNext() and

17
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:52,828
next() and so to make the data structure
iterable, we're going to implement those

18
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,837
things. It seems like a lot of baggage to
carry around and the reason that we do it,

19
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:04,768
why do we go to the trouble doing it is
that we can, if we have a data structure

20
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:10,795
that's iterable we can use a very compact
and elegant client code in Java, the so

21
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:16,185
called for-each statement. So if we have a
stack we can say - (for String s : stack).

22
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:22,587
It means for each string in the
stack - print it out. And if we didn't have

23
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:29,442
that we would now, if we're using
iterators, we could go ahead and write

24
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:35,550
this longhand code but nobody would ever
do that cuz it's equivalent to the

25
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,710
shorthand or we might have to write client
code that does a lot of unnecessary pushes

26
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,386
and pops just to do this iteration. So
that's the key is to be able to have

27
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:53,928
client code that is so compact for
iterating through items in the data

28
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:59,370
structure so we're going to provide
iteration for all our basic data

29
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,712
structures and it's not too hard to do
definitely worthwhile the effort. So

30
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:12,877
here's what it looks like for link list.
So it's got to implement Iterable so what

31
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:19,470
does that mean implement Iterable? It's
got to have a, a method iterator() that

32
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,017
returns an iterator. So what's an
iterator? So, we're going to use an

33
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:30,926
inner class. In this case, we'll call it
ListIterator that implements Iterator and

34
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:36,498
it's generic. And basically what this
thing has to do is implement these methods

35
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:42,158
hasNext() and next(). And the semantics just
clear from the names. hasNext() is supposed to

36
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:47,917
if, if we're done is supposed to return
false. If we're not done we're supposed to

37
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:53,462
return true and the next() is supposed to
give the next item in the iteration. So if

38
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:58,973
the thing is a linked list we're going to
start out at first. We have that's the,

39
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:04,896
our first item in the list and we're going
to maintain an instance variable current

40
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:10,461
inside this iterator which is the current
thing that we're iterating. So, get the

41
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:15,439
next one just like if we want to remove
the first. We pull out the current item

42
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,073
and then advance the current reference and
return item. Moving current to the next

43
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:27,483
place. The client is always going to be
testing hasNext() as I showed as I showed

44
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:35,069
and that stub code before and so when it
gets to null it will return false in the

45
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:41,084
iterational stop. But for our iteration,
we just have to worry about implementing

46
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:47,952
next() and hasNext() and perhaps using a local
instance variable to get it done. We have

47
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:54,457
to probably to make bullet proof code -
throw exceptions if a client tries to

48
00:04:54,457 --> 00:05:01,339
call next() with no items there and tries
to call remove() at all, we're not going

49
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,326
to support remove(). For, and for array,
it's even simpler. So now with the iterator we

50
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:13,041
have control over which order we go
through the items and so that's going to

51
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:18,834
go along with the semantics and the data
structure so probably in a stack you want

52
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:24,504
to get the things in stack order like the
order that come out of the stack so that's

53
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:31,686
reverse order in the array so in this case
then next() is just decrement and return the

54
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:37,522
next one and our instance variable is an
index in the array. And then hasNext() is

55
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:48,052
okay as long as that thing is positive. So
a little Java [cough] code to provide this

56
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:55,229
iteration facility but actually within
this framework not too much to do and you

57
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:02,108
can see how to implement this for your own
data type and we'll use this paradigm for

58
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:07,873
every basic data type that we, that
involves collections of objects that we'll

59
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:14,633
encounter. Alright, and in fact, it leads us
to actually for a lot of clients it

60
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:20,905
doesn't really matter what order we get
the items. Really often what we're doing

61
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:27,275
is just inserting items into a collection
and then, later on, iterating through the

62
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:34,410
items that we have. That data structure is
called a bag and so let's look at what

63
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,680
that API looks like. Order doesn't
matter so all we want to do is add an item

64
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:47,303
maybe you want to know the size and we
want to iterate through all the items in

65
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:53,986
the bag. So this is a simpler, narrower
API but still it expresses an important

66
00:06:53,986 --> 00:07:00,370
little collection of operations and, and
we'll use this one and we've already seen

67
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,512
the implementations. You just take stack
and remove the pop, or queue and remove the

68
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:13,072
dequeue [cough] and you have fine
implementation of a useful data structure.
