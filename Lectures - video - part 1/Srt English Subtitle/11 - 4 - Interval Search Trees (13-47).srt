1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:08,045
Okay next we're gonna look at another
extension of geometric algorithms to

2
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:12,096
process slightly more complicated objects
and then we'll see an important

3
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:18,421
application. This is called interval
search. So now instead of points, our data

4
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:25,056
is intervals. So this is, we'll start with
one dimension as before and right away you

5
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:31,223
can see that it's a more complicated
problem than we've been dealing with. So

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:37,006
we want to support the following
operations. We wanna be able to insert an

7
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:42,390
interval. So an interval is just a left
endpoint, right endpoint of a

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,606
1-dimensional data or points on the line.
We wanna be able to Insert an interval

9
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:54,960
search for an interval, delete an interval
but the main thing is we want the interval

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,105
intersection query. So given a query
interval, we want to find all intervals in

11
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:07,661
the data structure that overlap that
interval or find any interval we'll start

12
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:14,708
with that simpler problem. So how are we
going to support that? So this is the API

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:20,650
in Java code [cough], so We, have,
intervals, so instead of one key we have

14
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,863
two, which is left and right end points of
the interval for input. And [inaudible],

15
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:32,641
and then we have delete, and then we have
intersects. And again simplify the code,

16
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:39,304
we are going to make the non degeneracy
assumption that no two intervals have the

17
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:44,637
same left end point. [cough] and, [cough].
Easy, easy to fix but, but we don't

18
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:50,866
simplify the code. So now we'll look at a
data structure called an interval search

19
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:57,526
tree that helps to solve this problem.
And, it's a extremely, simple algorithim,

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,026
but surprisingly, complicated to
understand, so we'll go slowly. So the

21
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:10,081
first thing is what we're going to do is
use the left end point of each interval as

22
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:16,031
the binary search tree key. So our, eh,
our node stored intervals, but we only use

23
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:21,067
our left end point as the key. So this is
the binary search tree that's built from

24
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:27,003
those five intervals, six intervals in our
example. Seventeen, nineteen is at the

25
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:32,019
root, so everybody with a le ft end point
less than seventeen is to the left, the

26
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:37,059
left end point greater than seventeen is
to the right and so forth. So that's a

27
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:42,097
binary search tree built, from those
intervals. So that's easy. I just build a

28
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:48,426
binary search tree. I just use, the left
end point, as the search key. But we're

29
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:53,845
also in the, each node of the tree, we're
gonna store, not just the interval. But

30
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:59,295
we're gonna store the, largest endpoint in
the subtree rooted at that node. So at

31
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:05,340
every node, we're gonna store the maximum
endpoint and subtree rooted at that node.

32
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,336
So at the root, the maximum endpoint or
the rightmost point covered by an

33
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:15,440
interval, is 24. So we [inaudible] 24 at
the root, and, of course, the right

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,652
subtree. And the left subtree. The max end
point is that eighteen so that's what we

35
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:29,900
store for the associated data with the
note to the left of the root and so forth.

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,043
So. We going to have to, that's data that
we're going to have to maintain when we do

37
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:41,909
an insert and it's data that we'll use
when we're doing an interval-intersection

38
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:48,375
search. So let's take a look at an
insertion into an interval search tree

39
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:56,634
with a demo. All right, so, the, insertion
algorithm is pretty simple. We do the BST

40
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:04,057
insertion, just so we have to do that,
update of the maximum in each node on the

41
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:11,422
search path. So, to insert 16/22 in this
tree, while we use the, left endpoint as

42
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:17,621
the search key, sixteen is the left
endpoint of our insert interval [cough].

43
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:25,474
We compare that with seventeen and
therefore go left. How sixteen is bigger

44
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:34,005
than five so we go right. Now sixteen is
bigger than fifteen so we go right. And

45
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:43,035
that's null, so that's where we insert our
new, interval. [sound]. So now, we're

46
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:49,784
gonna go back up the tree. And, for every
node that we encounter, it could be that,

47
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:56,045
our right endpoint of our interval, is
bigger than what was there. So we have to

48
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:02,251
check, all the way up the path, the
maximum in each node on the path. So we

49
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:08,503
have to check each node, to see if 22 is
bigger, and, for the three nodes to the

50
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:14,496
left it is bigger than eighteen. For the
node at the root, it's not. That stays to

51
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:20,449
be 24. So, it's just binary tree
insertion, but then after the insertion on

52
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:27,415
the way up, we go ahead and, check, if the
maximum that we have is bigger than the

53
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:34,413
maximum there and update it if necessary.
So easy to code. [sound]. Alright, so now

54
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:42,528
about, how do we do a, a search. So the
searches is definitely more complicated

55
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:50,885
and kind of mysterious, but let's look at
the rules for search in an interval search

56
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:58,098
tree. Alright so now we're gonna look to
see if we have an intersection what a. We

57
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:02,880
want to find just. Any interval that
intersects this query interval 23 25.

58
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,089
We're not gonna try to find them all we'll
get back to that in a minute. Try to find

59
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,596
any interval that intersects our query
interval. So let's, let's see what we have

60
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:21,759
to do. So first thing is if At the root,
we have an intersection, then we're done.

61
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,517
We just return. In this case, 2325 does
not intersect, 1719. So, we have to go

62
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:35,312
down the tree somewhere. So left subtree
is [inaudible] right, okay? Otherwise, we

63
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:41,841
have to check whether the max endpoint in
the left subtree is less than, the low

64
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:47,967
point in our interval. [inaudible] it's
easy to see, well, if that's the case,

65
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:54,473
then we're not gonna find an intersection.
In the left. The maximum end-point in the

66
00:06:54,473 --> 00:07:00,383
left is 22, and we're looking for 23, and
we're not gonna find anything there, so we

67
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:06,883
just wanna go right. So in this case we'll
go right 22, 23 no inter sectional left,

68
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:13,499
so we go right and now we do find an
intersection 21, 24 does intersect with

69
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:20,478
23, 25 because 23 is in the middle there,
so we find an intersection. Now on the

70
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:27,379
other hand, let's say they were looking
for 1214, so no intersection. So. All the

71
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:34,231
algorithm says is that, if you didn't go
right, go left. So let's go left, in this

72
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:40,381
case. So we weren't able to show that
there was no intersection, on the left.

73
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:46,534
So, so we're gonna go left. In this we
compare twelve fourteen to five eight, so

74
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:52,097
now we apply the same rules. Does it
intersect? No, it doesn't intersect. So

75
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:58,373
should we go left. Well no, the maximum,
end point in the left node is eight. So we

76
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:04,403
can have intersection there, so we gonna
go right, [inaudible] to twelve and go

77
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:11,094
right. So, now does twelve, fourteen
intersect fifteen, eighteen it does not so

78
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:18,554
there's no intersection so now what do we
do. Should we go left no the max in point

79
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:26,401
on left is ten so we shouldn't go left. So
we're going to go right. Those 12-14

80
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:35,876
intersect 16-22. It does not, So, now, the
left end point's null. And so we're just

81
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:42,934
gonna go right. And there's no
intersection. So in both cases we just

82
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:49,439
went along one path in the tree to
determine whether or not there was an

83
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:57,040
interval or intersection. Let's look at
one more example. 21, 23. So let's see. 21

84
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,751
thru 23 to seventeen, nineteen. They do
not intersect, so now, what are we gonna

85
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:11,674
do next? Well we're gonna compare the left
sub-tree, and it's Not, 22 falls within

86
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:20,042
our interval so it's not less than'r' so
there might be an intersection there so we

87
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:26,650
better go to the left, so we do go to the
left. Now we compare against 5-8, and

88
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,949
there's no intersection. So now, we're
gonna go left to right. Well, we're gonna

89
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:39,172
go to the right, because, the max endpoint
in the left subtree is eight, and our

90
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:44,687
interval's 21, so no intersection on the
left. So we're gonna go right.

91
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:50,496
Intersection 21231518. They do not
intersect. So now, do we go left or right?

92
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:57,263
Again ten is less than our left endpoint
21. So we better go to the right. [cough].

93
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:04,135
And now 2123 does intersect 1622, so we
return and intersection. Again one path

94
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:10,003
through the tree to determine an
intersection. So from these rules you can

95
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:15,980
see that the man of code required to
implement this intersecting inter role is

96
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,229
extremely low. Just check for an
intersection, if we find it ret urn if

97
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:26,852
left is no we go right. Otherwise if the
max is less than low we go right.

98
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:33,052
Otherwise we go left. Could hardly be
simpler. Really amazingly simple and

99
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:40,216
efficient algorithm. We should convince
ourselves really that it always works and

100
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:46,713
so we'll spend just a moment on a short
proof. So let's look at the, the cases

101
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:53,045
that could happen. So first thing is if
the search goes right. Then there's no

102
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:58,553
intersection on the left. And that's easy
to convince ourselves of that just from,

103
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:04,052
from what we did in the demo. Of course,
if the last sub-tree's empty, there's no

104
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:09,082
intersection there. But if the max
endpoint in the left sub-tree is less than

105
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:15,038
low, that means every interval in the left
sub-tree has a max endpoint less than mah,

106
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:20,061
low, and so therefore it can't intersect.
So if you go right, there's no

107
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:25,077
intersection in the left. Any possible
intersection would have to be in the

108
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:30,354
right, And then the other point is that if
you go left, then either there's an

109
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:38,057
intersection there, or there's no
intersections at all. So Lets suppose that

110
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:43,315
there is no intersect, and that's
equivalent to saying, if there is no

111
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:50,225
intersection in the left then there is no
intersection in the right. So lets look at

112
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:56,015
it if there is no intersection in the
left, since we went to the left and then

113
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:01,089
we have got, low less than max. But, for
any interval, in the right subtree, its

114
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:08,557
got to appear after. Low. Be, because
since there's no intersections in the left

115
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:16,559
sub tree high has gotta be less than C.
Where, because they're sorted by left N

116
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:24,186
point. And then that means that C-s got to
be less than A if it is in the right, so

117
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:30,545
therefore there can't be any interesection
in the right either. No intersection in

118
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:36,988
the left means no intersections at all, so
those two cases is enough to show that

119
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:43,240
this algebroid finds an intersection, if
there is one. And the other thing we can

120
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,945
do with this is just use a red-black BST
to guarantee that we solved this in time

121
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:54,690
proportional to log in. So insert, find,
delete, and find any interval that

122
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,296
intersects. All take time, guaranteed,
proportional to log in. And if we wanna

123
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:08,630
find all intervals we just have to run the
algorithm fur Each interval that's, until

124
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:15,183
we come up against no intersection, so
it'll take time proportional to R log N if

125
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:21,778
there's R intervals that intersect. The
theoretical best that you could possibly

126
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:28,931
do would be R plus log N but in practice R
log N is quite efficient. This is an easy

127
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:35,283
and very efficient algorithm to solve this
interval search problem and as we'll see

128
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:40,618
this algorithm. It's applicable to an
important application that we'll see in a
