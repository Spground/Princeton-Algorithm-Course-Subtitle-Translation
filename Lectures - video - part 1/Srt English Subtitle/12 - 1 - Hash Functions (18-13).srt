00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,017
Welcome back.
Today we're going take a look at hashing,

2
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:11,127
which is another approach to implementing
symbol tables that can also be very

3
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:16,564
effective in practical applications.
Here's our summary where we left of with

4
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:21,216
red black BSTs, where we can get
guaranteed logarithmic performance for

5
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:26,915
broad range of symbol table operations.
And the question is, can we do better than

6
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,256
that.
Is logarithmic performance the best we can

7
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:33,663
do.
And the answer is that actually we can but

8
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,480
it's a different way of accessing the
data.

9
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:39,873
And also doesn't support ordered
operations.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:45,778
But there's plenty of applications where
the extra speed for search and insert that

11
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:52,774
we can get this way is worthwhile.
The basic plan is to think of the symbol

12
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:59,262
table, as really try to reduce the problem
to being like an array.

13
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:07,507
And what we do is use the function known
as a hash function, that takes the key a

14
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:14,319
symbol table key and reduces it to an
integer and array index.

15
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:22,010
Now we use that array index to store the
key in the value in an array,

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,355
Maybe the value in a parallel array.
Now, there are a lot of issues in doing

17
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:30,562
this.
First thing is we need to be able to

18
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:36,478
compute the hash function that is easy for
some types of data, but it can get

19
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:40,256
complicated for more complicated types of
data.

20
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,793
Then the other thing is that instead of
doing comparatives we're going to be doing

21
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:49,442
equality tests.
So we have to be sure we've got the method

22
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,613
that we want for checking whether two keys
are equal.

23
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:57,697
All we're going to do is look in to the
table and try to see if the key that's

24
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,330
there is equal to the key we're looking
for.

25
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:06,880
And then is the problem of collision
resolution where it's, since there are so

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,339
many possible values for typical data
type, your going to get the situation

27
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:15,687
where two values hash to the same array
index.

28
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:21,219
And we need a collision resolution
strategy to try to figure out what to do

29
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,222
in that case.
And these things are not difficult, but

30
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:30,827
they are all worth articulating as
separate issues that we have to deal with

31
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:35,360
in order to get an effective symbol table
implementation.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,048
Hashing really at its core is a classic
space time tradeoff.

33
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:46,456
If we had no limitation on space at all,
then we could have a very huge array with

34
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:51,848
space for every possible key and just use
the key itself as an index.

35
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:59,349
If our keys are 32 bit integer keys and
we've got a table of size two^32, then

36
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,599
we're just fine.
If there were no time limitation at all,

37
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,142
Then I would just hash everything to the
same place and then do sequential search.

38
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:13,315
But sequential search can be slow if we
have lots of keys.

39
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:18,858
So what hashing is kind of in the real
world where we're trying to trade off this

40
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:24,140
idea that we don't have unlimited space
and we also don't have unlimited time.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,140
So we are trying to find something in
between.

42
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,360
So we'll look at hash functions, separate
chaining.

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,711
And then two collision resolution methods,
called separate chaining and linear

44
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:42,762
probing.
Now look at the implementation of hash

45
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:46,670
functions.
So idealistically what I'd like is to be

46
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,342
able to take any key and uniformly
scramble it to produce a table index.

47
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:56,991
We have two requirements.
Now one is that, we have to be able to

48
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:01,797
compute the thing efficiently in a
reasonable amount of time.

49
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:07,942
And the other is that it should be the
case that every table index is equally

50
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:12,671
likely for each key.
Now mathematicians and computer scientists

51
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:18,407
have researched this problem in, a lot of
detail and its quiet a bit known about it,

52
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:24,477
but in practice, this is something that's
still, we have to worry about, somewhat.

53
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:28,680
So for example, lets suppose that our keys
are phone numbers.

54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,914
Probably a bad idea if you use the first
three digits of the phone number as a hash

55
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:37,945
function because so many phone numbers'ill
have the same area code.

56
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:42,758
It's not equally likely that each phone
number has the same, same first three

57
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,585
digits.
You have a better chance using the last

58
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,894
three digits.
But actually, in most cases, you want to

59
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:53,186
find a way to use all the data.
Another example, social security numbers.

60
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:57,614
Again, it's not to good to use the first
three digits because, their associated

61
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:02,285
with some geographic region and it's
better to try and use the last three

62
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:05,385
digits.
And the real practical challenge with

63
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:10,737
hashing is that with developing hash
function is,, that every type of key needs

64
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:15,240
a hash function and you need a different
approach for every key type.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,858
Now, for standard keys like integers, and
strings, and, doubles, and so forth.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,415
The, we can count on the implement,
designers and implementers of Java to

67
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:28,487
implement good hash function.
But, if we're going to be implementing

68
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:33,044
symbol with our own types of data.
We're going to have to worry about these

69
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:37,480
things in order to get a hash function
that's effective that leads to an

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,925
effective symbol table implementation.
So hashing is, widely used for, systems

71
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:50,877
programming and applications, so, some
conventions for hashing are built into

72
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:55,188
Java.
In particular, all Java classes inherit a

73
00:05:55,188 --> 00:06:00,732
method called hash code, which is, returns
a 32 bit int value.

74
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:08,300
And it's a requirement that if, x and t Y
are equal, then their hash code should be

75
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,356
equal.
So,

76
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,011
That's,
Something that is a convention that's

77
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:18,927
built into java and that enables the hash
code to be used for hashing.

78
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:24,967
Also, of course, if they're not equal then
you'd like it, like it to be that their

79
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,830
hash codes are not equal but you can't
always get that.

80
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:36,409
Now the default implementation for hashing
is the, memory address, of the object.

81
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:40,429
For hashing an object is the memory
address of an object.

82
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:44,871
So that, kind of, meets these two
requirements for Java.

83
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:50,513
The one that it doesn't, maybe, meet is
the idea that every table position should

84
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:55,096
be equally likely.
So, so usually we'll do some more work, to

85
00:06:55,096 --> 00:07:00,456
try to, make that one happen.
As far as the algorithms go, as far as the

86
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:04,590
rules go, you could always return
seventeen that's legal.

87
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:08,837
It doesn't have this, highly desirable
attribute.

88
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:14,181
But everything would compile.
So you have to be a little careful that

89
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:20,210
somebody isn't in there doing that.
And again for important.

90
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,042
Key types that lots of people are going to
use.

91
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:29,750
Some care has gone into the design of hash
functions and the built in

92
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,560
implementations.
So Java has customized implementations for

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,105
the standard data types that people would
use for simple table keys.

94
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:46,628
And that's the sweet spot for hashing
where some expert has done implementation

95
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:51,276
of the hash-code.
And also, your application does not need

96
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:55,133
ordering.
But for useful to find types, you're on

97
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,811
your own.
And we'll talk a little bit about how to

98
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,420
implement hash codes.
So here is the Java library

99
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,702
implementations for a few standard types.
And they are what they are, and what we'll

100
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:14,693
do is, with knowledge that that's what the
hash code is we'll do some extra work to

101
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:20,684
try to get this extra property that every
table position should seem to be equally

102
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:23,788
likely.
So if it's an integer, the hash code

103
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:28,912
supposed to be 32 bits, the integer
supposed to be 32 bits, so they just

104
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:33,226
return the value.
If it's a boolean, they pick out a couple

105
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:39,202
of particular values that they return so
hashing a boolean types, there's only two

106
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:44,456
different values so well it's hard to
think about what you really might want

107
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:48,199
there.
For double value this is the code they

108
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:53,058
convert to 64 bit and x or the most
significant 32 bits with the least

109
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:57,261
significant 32 bits.
This illustrates something that you want

110
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:02,777
to do if you have a lot of bits, you want
to try and involve all the bits somehow in

111
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:08,780
the hash function.
And for strings it kind of creates the

112
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:19,170
string as a, a huge number and then really
computes the value of that number a mod 32

113
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:27,475
it uses an arithmatic a way of evaluating
a polynomial or a number, a so called

114
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:32,033
Horner's Method, where for each digit, you
just multiply.

115
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:38,235
So it treats it as a base 31 number and to
get, to compute that whole number you

116
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:42,794
multiply 31 times where you have so far
and add the next digit.

117
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:48,099
And that's called Horner's rule and if
you're familiar with it, fine.

118
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:53,928
If you're not you can look at this little
example and decide what it is.

119
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:59,502
And again it involves all the characters
of the string, in completing the, hash

120
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:04,330
function.
So.

121
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:11,069
And actually, since strings are immutable,
what Java does is keep the hash value in

122
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,113
an instance variable so it only gets
computed once.

123
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,377
And that is going to be very effective for
performance in lots of applications.

124
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:26,690
So once it computes the hashcode, it
stores as an instance variable.

125
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,191
And the next time you ask for the hascode
for that string, it will just provide it.

126
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:36,760
And that works because strings are
immutable.

127
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,169
So how about implementing a hash code for
our own type of data.

128
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:48,522
And so, we might have, our transaction
type might have a couple of instance

129
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:55,133
variables, a string, a date, and a double.
And we need to compute a hash code, so

130
00:10:55,133 --> 00:11:00,456
return a 32 bit value.
And again, we want to try to make use of

131
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:07,068
all the pieces of data that we have.
And we also want to make use of the hash

132
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:12,165
code implementations for the types of data
that we're using.

133
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:19,607
So, one thing, to do is, start out with
some, small prime number, and this kind of

134
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:25,643
mimics, Horner's method, to, just add in
more data as we get it.

135
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:32,919
So we pick some other small prime number
and for each field we multiply by 31 and

136
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,660
then add the hash code for that field.
So,

137
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,530
If it's a reference type just use the hash
code, so who was a string?

138
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,949
So string has a hash code method, so we
add that in and dates and when's a date,

139
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,682
so we add that hash code, multiply it by
31 and add that hash code in.

140
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:58,581
Trying to take all the bits and scramble
all the bits and use'em and for primitive

141
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:01,874
types, take the wrapper type and use the
hash code.

142
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,567
So that's a, a simple example of
implementing a hash code for our own type

143
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:13,420
of data that might include several
different types of instants variables.

144
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,377
So that's the standard recipe.
Use the 31 x plus y rule to combine all

145
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:23,865
the fields.
If it's a primitive type, use the wrapper

146
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:27,620
hash code.
If the field is null, return zero.

147
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:34,546
And if it's a reference type, use that
hash code and apply it recursively.

148
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:40,014
And if you have an array, you have to
apply it to each entry.

149
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:45,664
Or actually Java implements that in the
array, in its arrays library.

150
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:52,316
So this recipe works pretty well in
practice and it's used in several, in

151
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:56,964
Java's libraries.
Now in theory it's possible to do

152
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:04,296
something that has the property that, that
all positions are equally likely.

153
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:10,306
It's called Universal Hash Functions.
These things exist, but they're not so

154
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:15,756
widely applied in practice.
So the basic rule is if you're computing

155
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:22,007
your own, try to use the whole key, but
consult an expert if you're seeing some

156
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:28,658
performance problems or you really want to
be certain in some performance critical

157
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:35,146
situation.
Now what we get back from the hash code is

158
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:42,331
a INT value that's between -two^31 and
two^31 - one.

159
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:49,430
Now, what we need is, if we have a table
of size m, an array of size m that we're

160
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:56,692
going to use to store the keys, we need an
int value between zero and m - one.

161
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:05,340
And the value of m is maybe a power of two
or sometimes we pick, pick a prime because

162
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,527
of the way that we normally would get the
big hash code value down to be a number

163
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:16,358
between zero and m - one is just to do Mod
m.

164
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:22,379
And if Mod, if m is a prime then, then
from math, Modular arithmetic, we know

165
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,540
that we are using all the bits in the
number in that point too.

166
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:34,699
Now, since the hash code can be negative
this doesn't quite work the way this

167
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:40,963
arithmetic is implemented in Java cuz it's
one in a billion times.

168
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:47,991
You really have to take the absolute value
well sorry you have to take the absolute

169
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:53,550
value I would because other wise it'd be
negative and you cannot have a negative,

170
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,977
you want it to be between zero and -one.
But even if you take the absolute value

171
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:06,058
there's going to have -two^31 is possible.
so you have to just take the 31 bits.

172
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:11,220
You get the hash code out make it positive
and then mod M as the way to go.

173
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:18,792
The math doesn't quite work out right so
anyway, that code down at the bottom is

174
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,743
You can use that as a template for what
you might want to do.

175
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:30,514
And that's what we do in order to get the
hash code to be a number between zero and

176
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:34,155
M minus one.
And if M is prime, it gives us some

177
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:40,999
comfort that we have some possibility of
each table position appearing with equal

178
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,771
likelihood.
So that's our assumption.

179
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:49,685
That each key is equally likely to hash to
an integer between zero and m-1.

180
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:55,993
And this assumption again, it's, with work
it's possible to come close to this.

181
00:15:55,993 --> 00:16:00,093
Lots of researches have done good work to
show this.

182
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:06,677
We'll assume that as a starting point.
And that allows us to model the situation

183
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:13,512
with the so-called bins and balls model
that directly relates the study of hash

184
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:21,328
functions to classical probability theory.
So we've got the n bins, that's our That's

185
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:27,659
our corresponds to our hash table and we
get M balls and with some number of balls,

186
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,958
however many keys we have and we throw'em
uniformly, at random, into M bins.

187
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,605
And, with.
These things are studied in classical

188
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:40,940
combinatoric analysis.
For example, there's the birthday problem.

189
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:46,514
Which, how many balls do you throw before
you find two hitting the same bin?

190
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:51,744
When do you get the first collision?
And the answer to that is, it's about

191
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:56,168
square root of pi M over two.
When does all the bins fill up?

192
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,454
That's called the coupon collector
problem.

193
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:04,240
After about m, natural log m tosses, every
bin has at least one ball.

194
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:09,740
Those are just examples of classic results
from commonatorial analysis.

195
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:16,240
It help us understand what happens when we
do this, which is what we're doing with

196
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,954
hashing.
And we'll look at more advanced versions

197
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:24,240
of these problems when we wanna study
hashing.

198
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:31,148
And in particular it's known that after
you've thrown n balls into the n bins,

199
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:36,302
then the most loaded bin has about log m
over log, log n balls.

200
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:44,947
So that's going to help us get a handle on
the performance of hashing algorithms when

201
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:52,013
we get to the implementations.
So this is just an example showing all the

202
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:59,828
words in a tale of two cities using the
modular hashing function for strings like

203
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:05,100
the one that Java uses.
And their pretty uniformly distributed.

204
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,700
And that's the summary for hash functions.
