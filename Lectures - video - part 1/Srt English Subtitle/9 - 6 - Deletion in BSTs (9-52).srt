1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:07,092
If our symbols table's really going to be
dynamic, we need to be able to delete key

2
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:13,074
valued pairs from the table. As we'll see,
all symbol table implementations have,

3
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:19,078
lead to complications when we try to do
this operation. Binary search trace is our

4
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:26,051
first example. So we need to fill in this
one table. What's, what's the cost of

5
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:31,081
deletion in a binary search tree? How are
we going to really do that? Well let's

6
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:38,073
take a look at a very lazy approach which
we set up for in our basic conventions for

7
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:45,048
simple tables. What we can do to remove a
node with a give key is just mark it with

8
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:51,013
a tombstone. Say, well, we'll leave the
key in the tree to guide searches, but we

9
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:56,061
won't, count it as being in the symbol
table. And actually you can, make some

10
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:02,098
progress with this kind of method. Leaving
tombstone throughout the tree. And, make

11
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:08,026
sure that you keep, as long as there
aren't too many deletions, you can keep

12
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:14,029
the search costs, and deletion and insert
costs to be logarithmic. But it definitely

13
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:19,071
becomes, inconvenient to manage large
numbers of tombstones in highly dynamic

14
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:24,022
situations with large numbers of keys and
values. Eventually you're going to get an

15
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:28,095
overload of memory and you're going to
have to rebuild the thing or clean out the

16
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:33,079
tombstones in some way so we need to look
for a better way. This is a general method

17
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,046
that people often use on all different
types of implementations, but in modern

18
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:45,045
systems it's rather unsatisfactory. Also
got a simpler problem. What about deleting

19
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:52,720
the minimum? Well actually, that's maybe
not too difficult to delete the minimum in

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,855
a binary search tree. Again, we just go to
the left until we get a null left link.

21
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:04,049
And then, what we can do is just return
that node's right link then that old node,

22
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,760
nobody's pointing to it, so it's available
for garbage collection. And then we use

23
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,012
our usual trick of returning the link that
we went down to update the other links

24
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:20,664
after the recursive calls. And also we
have to update the counts, something

25
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:26,043
happened down below and we used that code
to update the counts, in a co nsistent

26
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:33,814
way, so this code implements deleting, not
too bad at all. If x. Left null, return x

27
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:42,631
right. Otherwise x left = delete min x
left. And then when you're done with that,

28
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:49,202
it fix the count so maybe a node got
deleted down there, but always, the

29
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:55,780
invariant is that the count of the node is
one + size of the left and right. And then

30
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,017
return x and fix the links and the counts
on the way up. That's a fine

31
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:07,100
implementation for delete min, and it also
works for delete max. And that's the basis

32
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:14,355
for a general method for deleting nodes
from BSTs known as Hibberd deletion. So,

33
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:22,113
that's the second case, the first case for
Hibberd deletion is what we want to do to

34
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:27,631
delete a, a node with key K, is we search
for the node that contains the key, and

35
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:33,528
the easiest case is that node has no
children. So to, to delete a node that has

36
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:40,887
no children just return null. And then go
back up to update the counts as usual,

37
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:48,060
that's the easy case. The next most
difficult case is like the delete min case

38
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,687
we find a node T that contains our key, so
like deleting R in this tree, it only has

39
00:03:55,687 --> 00:04:01,526
one child. Just go ahead and return the
link to that child and that updates the

40
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:07,110
link and everything works fine and then
the node that the leads that available for

41
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,939
garbage collection that nobody's pointing
to it. And then again update all the

42
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,084
accounts after the recursive calls. Zero
children no problem one child no problem.

43
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:22,594
The problem is what happens when there is
two children. So say we want to delete

44
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:28,763
node E in this tree. We have only one
link, and we can get rid of the node but

45
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:35,422
we have only one link pointing to it. But
we have two links pointing down from it.

46
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:41,887
So what are we going to do with those two
links? Well the Hibbard deletion mechanism

47
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:48,473
which is pretty old. 50 years ago, it was
proposed. Says, go ahead and find the next

48
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:55,618
smallest node in the right subtree of that
tree. So in the case that's H and what's

49
00:04:55,618 --> 00:05:03,062
that node? Well it's the minimum in T's
right sub tree. And we know how to delete

50
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:10,554
the minimum. So we just find that minimum
node and, in this case it's H, and we put

51
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:16,851
that node in T spot and then delete the
minimum. So, find the H that's the

52
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:22,539
minimum, hang on to it, and then delete
the minimum NT sub tree and then, so we

53
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:28,179
take the E, replace it with the H, delete
the H, and then everything is fine. It is

54
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:33,432
still a BST. So we, essentially we are
finding a node that has only one link,

55
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:39,079
deleting that node, and then replacing the
node that we need to delete with that one.

56
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,163
That's Hibbard deletion. It's a little bit
asymmetric. Why are we using the successor

57
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:51,116
and not the predecessor? No real reason.
And it's not really satisfactory because

58
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:57,758
of that, and we'll come back to this but
it works. So this is the code for Hibbard

59
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:03,982
deletion. So we search for the key. If
it's got no right child, we're fine. We

60
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:10,220
just return, x out left, and that handles
both cases zero and one. If it does have a

61
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,590
right child, then we do this, find the
minimum, on the right. Delete min on the

62
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,417
right and then fix the links and then
update our count that covers all cases. So

63
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,468
actually not that much code, it's
complicated but not particularly more

64
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:32,196
complicated than other code we have seen
like rank and floor and ceiling and that

65
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:38,107
implements Hibbard deletion. So now we
have a fully dynamic symbol table where we

66
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:43,918
can insert and delete. The number of nodes
that we have in the tree as always

67
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,160
proportion to the number of key value
pairs in the symbol table. And the problem

68
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,286
is, and this was quite a surprise when it
was first discovered actually many years

69
00:06:56,286 --> 00:07:02,306
after Hibbard proposed the algorithm is
this lack of symmetry that tends to lead

70
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:08,171
to difficulties. And here we are just
inserting the leading alternating insert

71
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:13,466
and delete a random key. So that maybe
well models a situation, practical

72
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:19,340
situation. And as you watch it go for
awhile. You can see that this thing about

73
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,355
going to the right and taking the
successor all the time. The tree's

74
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:31,041
becoming much less balanced than it was.
And, this seems to be a, a problem. We

75
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:38,049
can't be having, supposedly having a
dynamic situation, that is going to, allow

76
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:44,975
support of lots of different inserts and
de letes. And in the end, win up with a

77
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:52,104
less balanced tree. What's worse, if you,
so how you are going to fix it? At the end

78
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:57,452
researches show that after, sufficiently
long sequence of random inserts and

79
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:03,375
deletes, the height of the tree becomes
square root of N not lg N. Square root of

80
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:09,498
N is usually bigger than lg N. It might
make difference between acceptable and

81
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:15,005
unacceptable performance in real
applications. Then what's worse is you try

82
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:20,757
to fix it by say randomly choosing between
the left and the right, that doesn't work,

83
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:25,615
it still becomes square root of N. And
that's a very long standing open problem

84
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:30,010
to find a natural, simple, efficient
delete for binary search trees. That's

85
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,582
another one like merging in place, that
you think there ought to be another easy

86
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:40,935
way to do it, but in 50 years no one's
really discovered one. Now we're going to

87
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:46,564
look at something pretty close in the next
lecture, but here's the situation that

88
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:52,291
we're left with. We have a binary search
tree algorithm, which is fine in that

89
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:57,680
gives us lg N performance for search and
insert, in a situation where we can think

90
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,010
that these things are happening randomly.
But we're kind of stuck if we allowed

91
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,512
delete. In fact everything regenerates to
square root of N, and we also have a

92
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:15,176
problem with, with the worst case if the
keys happen to have some order in them our

93
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:20,453
trees are not going to be balanced at all.
And that's going to make the difference

94
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:25,861
between acceptable and not acceptable
performance. What we're going to look at

95
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,780
next time, called a red black minor search
tree, will guarantee logarithmic

96
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,682
performance for all operations. So that's
extremely significant and much better then

97
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:41,169
binary search trees but the delete
operation for binary search trees shows us

98
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:45,289
the kind of complexity that we can
encounter with working with these kinds of

99
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,080
data structures.
