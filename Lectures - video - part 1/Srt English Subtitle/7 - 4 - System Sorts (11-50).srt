1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:06,054
Now, we'll take a look at how the sorting
algorithms that we talked about or

2
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:12,019
expressed in the systems that we use
everyday. Now, the key point is that

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,778
sorting algorithms rhythms are essential
in a very broad variety of applications

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:22,829
and, and all of us use sorting algorithms
pretty much every day. Many obvious out

5
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:29,057
applications like or, organizing your
music library or displaying your search

6
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:36,042
results or listening feeds in your in your
web browsers. There's some other

7
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:43,777
applications that are not so obvious where
we use sorting as a to make a problem easy

8
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:49,794
once you know that they're sorted. And so,
for example, finding the median and if

9
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:54,508
it's already sorted, it's much easy to
find the median. And now, the statistical

10
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:59,303
problems are like that or finding
duplicates. Probably finding duplicates by

11
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:03,923
itself is not quite obvious what to do but
the easy way to solve it is to just go

12
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:08,645
ahead and sort. And then there are plenty
of applications that we'll see later in

13
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:14,422
this course like data compression or
computer graphics like finding the convex

14
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:19,943
hull, applications in science such as
computational biology or, or in systems

15
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:25,878
development. We're having a efficient sort
as absolutely crucial. So, because there's

16
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:31,710
all these applications most programming
systems have a fast sort as an important

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,725
part of their infrastructure and Java is
no exemption. So, Java has a method called

18
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:44,668
arrays.sort and it's intended to be a
general purpose sorting method for use by

19
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:50,844
Java programmers. And now, that you have
some understanding of the classic methods

20
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:57,532
you can have a better idea of why
arrays.sort is the way that it is. So it

21
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:04,256
has the infrastructure that allows us to
be used for all types of data types and

22
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:11,001
all types of ordering so it's got a method
that implements comparable then its got

23
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:17,146
methods easy compare order. So that you
can use the natural order or you can

24
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:24,413
provide a compare order and provide your
own order for any type of data. It uses

25
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:32,379
actually both quicksort and mergesort. It
uses two quick sort for primitive types of

26
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,951
data and a two mergesort for objects. Why
two different well it's just the

27
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:45,955
designer's assessment of the idea that if
a programmer is using object maybe spaces,

28
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:50,969
not a, a critically important
consideration. And so, the extra space

29
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,182
used by merge sort maybe is not a problem.
And if the program is using primitive

30
00:02:56,182 --> 00:03:01,136
types, maybe performance is the most
important thing. And so, then we'll use

31
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:07,733
the quicksort. To invoke arrays that sort,
you have to import the name space from

32
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:15,010
java.util.Arrays and then all you need to
do is invoke Arrays.sort. So I just

33
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,008
answered this question, why do we use
different algorithms for the two types?

34
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,934
And this is, is maybe arguable. Now are
referred to this idea of a good system

35
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:34,812
sort, there was a good system sort that a
lot of people used for many years. And in

36
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:41,233
1991, there were some scientists that,
that Bell Labs that were using qsort for a

37
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:47,916
scientific problem and they were used to
taking just a few minutes and then they

38
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:55,021
realized that it was taking hours of CPU
time. And the fact was that all the qsort

39
00:03:55,021 --> 00:04:00,875
implementations at that time in Unix had
this flaw well, there are two flaws and

40
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:07,126
one of them is a little complicated about
the way they are raised order and the

41
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:13,754
other one was for a raise that had lots of
equal keys and this is Wilks and Becker

42
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:19,436
problem and have lot of equal keys, it was
quadratic time. So, the system designer,

43
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:25,093
Jon Bentley was one of the designers to
take a look at these problems and that

44
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:31,057
lead ultimately to the development of the
3-way quick sort that were used today. He

45
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:36,985
worked with Doug McIlroy and they wrote a,
a, a paper that outline this problem and

46
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:42,965
talk about some of these things and they
had a three-way partitioning method that

47
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:49,507
was somewhat like the Dijkstra method that
we showed but a bit more complicated.

48
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:57,215
Anoth er thing they did was rather than
shuffling the array. They [cough] used

49
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,001
what's called a method for choosing
partitioning element called Tukey's

50
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:08,595
ninther. Tukey is a statistician and he
had this particular method for order

51
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:13,910
statistics that has some interesting
properties and use that for the

52
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,624
partitioning element. This paper was very
influential and, and that basic method is

53
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:25,796
widely used. And Tukey's ninther is just
pick nine items out of the array and take

54
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:31,375
the median of the mediums and that's the
ninther. So very inexpensive and they had

55
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:38,618
macros to do this so and use not too much
cost to find a partitioning element that's

56
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:44,704
much closer to the middle than, and if you
use a, a random one. So the, the reason

57
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:51,051
they used that is they thought they got
them closer to the middle and they also

58
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:57,043
don't like the, some system designers
don't like the idea of using random

59
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:03,504
choices in a system method because of way
that it changes the state of the system.

60
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,296
So they felt that they got better
partitioning than a random shuffling and

61
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:13,028
it was also less costly and then
generating random numbers including this

62
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:18,580
change of state problem. But there's a
problem so you would think that the system

63
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,999
sort would be completely solid with all
this resource with all these research and

64
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:31,283
all of the development that's going into
it. In fact there's a file out there in

65
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:36,863
your book site and get it that will
actually break the Java system sort. There

66
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:43,357
was a killer input that will make the
thing run in quadratic time. Actually it

67
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:49,371
usually crashes because it's recursive and
it crashes the system stack. And it can

68
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:56,015
cause all sorts of problems. There's a
killer input for the system sort and, and

69
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:02,780
it can be disastrous in various systems
and the reason is, they didn't do the

70
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:10,511
random shuffling. Mcilroy, himself,
actually found this problem that you could

71
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:17,839
while the sort is running figuring out an
inp ut that would make it crash. And so,

72
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,881
you can just run that program and if the
sort doesn't use randomness then it's

73
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:29,589
vulnerable to this attack. So which
algorithm should we use to sort that's,

74
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:35,075
that's really a key question. We've looked
at lot of sorting algorithms and actually,

75
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:41,348
there's hundreds of sorting algorithms out
there and we have chosen the most

76
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:47,231
important and the most interesting for you
but you could literally spend a year

77
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:53,649
reading all the papers on sorting and then
you still continue to be invented new

78
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,980
algorithms are developed and that are
found to have good characteristics all the

79
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,943
time. And really, the key idea is really
important to think about cuz it applies to

80
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:09,272
all sorts of algorithmic problems. On our
way, we've been talking about rules of the

81
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:14,837
game. What is it that we care about in a
sort? It's a little bit more complicated

82
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:19,630
than just put stuff in order. There's a
lot of attributes, the different

83
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:25,050
applications have. Like stability, that's
a fairly sophisticated attribute that you

84
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,361
really have to think about, you maybe not
be aware of. Maybe your computer is

85
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,117
parallel and the sort has to be parallel
and we found that equal keys make a huge

86
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:38,778
difference. And I didn't really think
about that at the beginning but it can

87
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:44,195
make a huge difference. Maybe the way your
computer's memory is organized make a

88
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:49,158
difference. Maybe the keys are small and
the items are large or maybe the keys are

89
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:53,638
really huge. Do we need guaranteed
performance? Are we happy with random

90
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:57,968
performance? Do we know, is the array
randomly ordered? You can think of a

91
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:03,297
matrix shown in the right here where we
list out all the possible attributes and

92
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:08,756
then there's algorithms that worked well
for different combinations of attributes.

93
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:14,042
But the thing is, there is way more
possible combinations of attributes than

94
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:19,848
there are algorithms. So there is going to
be situations that are going to require an

95
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:26,291
understanding of what it takes to engineer
a, a sort method that's appropriate for

96
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:32,896
your application. There can't be a system
sort out there that's going to cover all

97
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:39,307
possible combinations of attributes. Now,
usually it's going to be good enough but

98
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:44,956
it's definitely worth while to understand
what's going on with different sorting

99
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:50,639
algorithms in order to even find improved
performance over the system sort. So,

100
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,255
here's the summary of some of the things
that we've talked about. We've talked

101
00:09:56,255 --> 00:10:01,505
about six different sorting algorithms.
Then, we've talked about a bunch of

102
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:07,418
attributes. For example, the top line,
selection sort is in place it always takes

103
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:12,671
about N^2 / two comparisons. And one of
the things to remark about it is that it

104
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:17,251
only uses N exchanges and so forth.
Insertion sort best case linear,

105
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:25,026
quadratic, and place unstable. And it'll
work well if the file is small or

106
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:31,994
partially ordered. Shellsort, we don't
know it's a running time, it's not stable

107
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:39,169
but it's a fast method for intermediate
size files and not much code. Mergesort

108
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:45,384
and log N guarantee unstable but not in
place, need that auxiliary array.

109
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:52,646
Quicksort not stable. Quadratic time worst
case but that's unlikely to occur if you

110
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:58,125
do the random shuffling. And its the
fastest and most useful in practice

111
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:04,111
particularly if you make improvements to
deal with duplicate keys. And it's

112
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:10,562
interesting to note we've looked at
important and classic algorithms that are

113
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:15,877
widely deployed but we don't have a, a
useful, practical algorithms that are

114
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:21,406
widely used that's got all of these
characteristics that's in place and stable

115
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:29,038
worst case N log N. There's versions of
merge sort that come close but they are

116
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:34,962
too complex for practitioners to have
adopted them. Those are some of the

117
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:42,381
situations that we encounter when
developing a system sort. And, quicksort

118
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:50,049
certainly plays a role in most system
sorts.
