1
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:09,074
Now, we'll look at red black BSTs which is
a simple data structure that allows us to

2
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:16,886
implement 2-3 tree with very little extra
code beyond the basic binary search tree

3
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:23,022
code. So this is, and actually the version
that we're going to, looking at is called

4
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:29,166
left-leaning red-black BSTs. On a personal
note, I wrote a research paper on this

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:34,484
topic in 1979 with Leo Givas and we
thought we pretty well understood these

6
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:41,097
data structures at that time and people
around the world use them in implementing

7
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:47,760
various different systems. But just a few
years ago for this course I found a much

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,949
simpler implementation of red-black trees
and this is just the a case study showing

9
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,175
that there are simple algorithms still out
there waiting to be discovered and this is

10
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:02,761
one of them that we're going to talk
about. So, the idea is that we are, are

11
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:09,585
going to represent every two, three tree
as a binary search tree. And in order to

12
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:14,418
get that done, we just need a simple
representation for three notes. So, what

13
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:20,061
we are going to do is use internal
left-leaning links to glue the three nodes

14
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:26,026
together. So, the larger of the two nodes
in the tree node will always be the root

15
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:32,019
of a little binary search tree of size two
for the three node and the link between

16
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:37,084
the two nodes, the left link that links
the larger key to the smaller one we'll

17
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:43,077
color red. And that's to distinguish those
links from the other links in the binary

18
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:49,039
tree so that we can tell when we're
inserting things which nodes belong to

19
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:55,371
tree nodes and which ones don't. And you
can see from this transformation that it's

20
00:01:55,371 --> 00:02:01,036
easy to perform this, see this
correspondence the middle link between A

21
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:06,801
and B, those are the keys that are less
than B and larger than A. So, that takes

22
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:12,449
two comparisons to get to them the ones
that are less than A, less than, less than

23
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:18,565
A, that's two comparisons for that and the
ones that are greater than B are the right

24
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:23,572
link of B. So, just following those three
cases, I see t hat this correspondence is

25
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:29,547
going to work. So, any 2-3 tree
corresponds to a left leaning red-black

26
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:37,951
BST in this way. Just take the three nodes
and split them into little binary search

27
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:44,803
tree of size two held together by a red
link. And correspondingly given a

28
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:51,249
red-black BST then you can get the 2-3
tree if you wanted it. But just look at

29
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:57,341
the properties of looking at the
properties over a left leaning red-black

30
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:03,748
BST. You know, with reference to what we
know about 2-3 trees. First of all no node

31
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:09,693
has two red links connected to it cuz the
only red links are internal to three

32
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:15,816
nodes. And those have to have ex, external
links or tree links connecting them to

33
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:22,148
some other node. Every path from the root
down to a null link has the same number of

34
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:28,020
black links that just follows directly
from the corresponding property for 2-3

35
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,525
trees. A left-leaning red-black BST has
perfect black balance. And all the red

36
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:39,553
links lean left. So, given a BST with some
of the links colored red that has those

37
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:45,934
properties that's going to correspond to a
2-3 tree. And that's a key property is

38
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:51,514
this one-to-one correspondence between 2-3
trees and left-leaning red-black trees.

39
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:56,936
Given a 2-3 tree, we saw how to do it.
Given a, a, given a red-black tree, we

40
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:02,974
just make the red links horizontal, and
merge the nodes together to be three

41
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:08,647
nodes. So, all of the operations that
we're going to look at for red-black trees

42
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:14,106
can be understood in terms of the
corresponding operations on 2-3 trees. Now

43
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:20,079
the first, and really one of the most
critical observations, is that search in a

44
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,971
red-black BST is exactly the same as for
an elementary BST, we just ignore the

45
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:32,195
color. Now, it's going to be much faster
because of better balance in the tree, but

46
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:37,997
in terms of the code, we don't have to
change the code at all. Our regular search

47
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:44,520
code doesn't examine the color of a link
and so we can just use it exactly as is.

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,909
And in fact, most of the other operations
that we implemented on BSTs are also

49
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:55,203
identical. They d on't need the colors,
but they can all benefit from the fact

50
00:04:55,203 --> 00:05:00,743
that the trees are much better balanced.
So this aspect of red-black BSTs is an

51
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:06,231
extremely nice one because of the
operations that we implemented for regular

52
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:11,537
BSTs that involves some complicated code
for floor and ceiling and rank and so

53
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:17,096
forth, and we don't have to change that
code at all. We just during the insertion,

54
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:23,269
make sure that we, we [cough] maintain the
properties the balance properties and by

55
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:28,884
doing that, we wind up with balance trees
and we make all the operations quick and

56
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:35,411
we don't have to re-implement, we don't
have to change it at all. So first before

57
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:42,227
we get to the code for insertion, we have
to look at the representation. We don't

58
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:49,308
actually have explicit representation of
links or links in trees or just references

59
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:56,131
to nodes. You could implement this by
building explicit links but the an easier

60
00:05:56,131 --> 00:06:03,284
thing to do is to know that every node is
referenced by just one link in a tree the

61
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:09,986
one from it's parent. So, you can put the
color of a link in the node that it

62
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:18,812
references. So, in this case we have a red
link connecting E and C. What we do is put

63
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:26,549
a bit, a color bit in each in the node
class. And then, if the link coming into a

64
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:35,158
node is red we set that to true. So this
simple thing just tests is a node red. We

65
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:42,271
consider all null nodes to be black null
links to be black, we don't have red links

66
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:48,753
dangling off, that would be incomplete
pre-nodes. And [cough] otherwise if the

67
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:54,557
color's red, we return true otherwise
return false to test whether a node is

68
00:06:54,557 --> 00:07:01,509
red. So in this tree, the color of h.left
is red, the color of h.right is black and

69
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:07,608
so forth. So, that's the way we represent
colors by putting the, a color bit in the

70
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:12,602
node for the color of the length that
points to it. [cough] Alright, so now,

71
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:18,742
there's a couple of elementary operations
that we have to perform on red-black

72
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:24,666
trees, called rotations. And the idea is
that during the construction of a tree, or

73
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:31,003
during an insertion operation, sometimes
we wind up with red links that are leaning

74
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:37,960
in the wrong direction. And so we'll need
what's called a left rotation, and the job

75
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,335
of that operation is to take a, a right
leaning red link that is there for

76
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:50,638
whatever reason and reorient it to lean to
the left. [cough] so, in this case, we

77
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:57,760
have the right link of E points to S and S
is red so that's a right-leaning red link

78
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:05,032
and so now that's the before and what we
want to do is reorient things so that it

79
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:11,764
leans to the left. And again, that has to
be a local operation that only changes a

80
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:19,783
few links and just from the diagram it's
not difficult to see that this little bit

81
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:27,833
of code will do the job. If we start with
a right-leaning red link. So, first thing

82
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:35,441
we do is take the reference of h.right,
and save that in x. So, that's the node

83
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:44,057
that's going to be the new root of the
three nodes so to speak. And, and then,

84
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:51,915
x.left after the rotation is going to be
h. And also whatever color h was, well, it

85
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:56,835
looks like it should be black. But
actually this situation is where it could

86
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:03,318
be red. Then x is going to have that color
cuz the link coming into h is going to be

87
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:09,232
the link coming into x. And then h's color
is going to be black afterwards. And then,

88
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:15,039
we return x to link further up the tree
which happens during our standard

89
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:24,481
recursive insert. So, that's a rotate left
operation. Now, the property of this

90
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:30,817
operation that's very important is it
maintains a symmetric order. The keys

91
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:36,085
between E and S are still there. We just
changed the way we get to them. And the

92
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:42,480
keys less than E and so forth. And also we
maintain perfect black balance because we

93
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,349
didn't change the black height, height of
anything by doing this transformation. All

94
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:54,564
those subtrees, those three subtrees are
exactly the same relative to the top and

95
00:09:54,564 --> 00:10:05,861
bottom of the tree, as they were before
the rotation. Now paradoxically and you'll

96
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:13,138
see why very soon it also turns out that
to get the insertion done properly we

97
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:19,158
sometimes need to take a left-leaning red
link and temporarily make it lean right.

98
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:25,520
And later on, we'll get it back to the
left again. But anyway, that's a basic

99
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,745
operation that we sometimes need. And so
that's just the symmetric code to the code

100
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:39,609
that we just did. Now again, now x is
h.left. And h.left is going to be x.right

101
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:45,301
after the rotation. X's color is still
going to be h's color. And h's color is

102
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:52,072
going to be red. And the right rotation
implements this and again that's going to

103
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:58,695
maintain a, a symmetric order in perfect
black balance we change the way the red

104
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:06,336
goes but we didn't change anything about
the black. Okay, that's a right rotation.

105
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:12,094
Now, here's the third elementary operation
that we're going to perform. It's called a

106
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:17,911
color flip. Sometimes during the
insertion, we might wind up with a node

107
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:23,459
that's got two red links coming out of it.
That's corresponds precisely to our

108
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:30,035
temporary four node when we're doing 2-3
trees. And what we wanted to do with the

109
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:35,092
temporary four node was to split it and
pass the center node up to the root. Well,

110
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:41,002
you can see from this structure that we're
all set to do that all we need to do

111
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:46,037
actually is not change any links, just
change all the colors. And so, that is, we

112
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:53,001
change the link from E to A and from E to
S to be black. That essentially splits the

113
00:11:53,001 --> 00:12:00,006
four node. And then, we want to insert the
E into its parent. And we just do that by

114
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:05,059
changing its link to be red. So, that's
flipping the colors. And that's the way we

115
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,605
split a temporary four node in a
left-linear red-black tree. And again,

116
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:14,452
that's just flipping colors. It doesn't
change any links so it still, of course,

117
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:19,007
maintains symmetric order and perfect
black balance. So, those are the three

118
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:24,151
basic operations we're going to use.
Rotate left, rotate right and flip colors.

119
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:30,173
So, the basic s trategy is, with those
operations, maintain one-to-one

120
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:38,932
correspondence with 2-3 trees when we do
insertions. So, here's an example. If we

121
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:47,262
want to insert C into this red black tree
which is a representation of this 2-3

122
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:54,240
tree, then C is going to be less than E
greater than A. So, it will get added to,

123
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,233
as the right link of A and every time we
add a node we just create a red link to

124
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:07,210
its parents and so, that's changing the
two node into a three node. In this case

125
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,159
it's three nodes that's oriented the wrong
way so we need to do a left rotate. After

126
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,151
we do the left rotate, we have a legal
left-leaning red-black tree, and it

127
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:24,124
exactly corresponds to that 2-3 tree, so
the insertion of C gives us exactly what

128
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:28,775
we would want, that correspondence with
the 2-3 tree. We have to work through

129
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:35,551
other cases that can arise but there's not
too many so we'll work through and we have

130
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:40,529
the basic operations, left rotate, right
rotate, and flip colors. Alright, so

131
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:46,112
first, warm up, insert into a tree with
exactly one node. Well, if it goes on the

132
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:52,010
left, then we just make a red link and add
it on then we're done. If it goes on the

133
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,520
right, then we attach a new node with the
red link on the right but we have to

134
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,131
rotate it to the left to make a legal
three node. So, that's inserting to a tree

135
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:09,822
with the one node and make it a tree with
two nodes. And that one generalizes to

136
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:18,033
help us insert into a two node at the
bottom. So, we do the standard BST insert

137
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:26,085
color the new link red and then if that
[cough] new three node happens to lean

138
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:31,863
right, rotated to the left. That's the
case that we just did. So now, let's look

139
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:38,233
at the second warm-up. So, say, we have
just two nodes in the tree, so it's we

140
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:43,569
have two nodes and that means it's a
single three node. Then there's three

141
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:49,130
cases. So, one is that the new one is
larger than both of the keys. If that's

142
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,387
true, then we attach the new node with the
red link as always. And that gives us a

143
00:14:55,387 --> 00:15:01,091
temporary four node. And what we want to
do is split that four node and in this

144
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:06,645
case, since we are at the root that's all
so that just flips the colors. Now, the

145
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:12,053
color of the root in our code will
temporarily turn red and then we turn it

146
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:18,000
black again. So, that's inserting into a
tree that's a single three node a node

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,083
that's larger than both of them, a key
that is larger than both of them and we

148
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:27,444
get wind up with a four node. Well, let's
look at the other two cases and these

149
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:32,493
understanding needs is crucial to
understanding the whole algorithm. Let's

150
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:38,846
say, the new key is smaller than both of
the keys in our three node. Now, we attach

151
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:45,455
a new link at the left of the smaller
node. And now, we've gotta find BST. But

152
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:51,072
it has two red links in a row. And that's
something that's not allowed. So, what

153
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:57,780
we're going to do is we're going to rotate
the top link to the right. So that puts B

154
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:05,371
at the root. And now, it's got two red
children. It reduces to this case. And we

155
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:13,564
flip the colors and we have a single four
node. Sorry a, a red black. A tree that's

156
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:19,235
got three two-nodes and no red links so
same situation as before. So, we had a

157
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:25,035
single temporary four note and we split it
up into a two, two note not connected to a

158
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:31,018
four note. And then, so that's the case
when it's smaller. Now, we have to look at

159
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:37,030
the third case, which is, when it's, the
new node inserted this in between and

160
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,373
comes out of this link here. Again, we
just had a red link and now we have a BST

161
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:48,096
with two red links along the path
connected to A and that's not allowed. In

162
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:55,001
this case it's a bit trickier to affix the
situation, what we do is we rotate the

163
00:16:55,001 --> 00:17:01,097
bottom link left. So, and that gives us
this and reduce it to the other situation

164
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:09,324
that we had before. And then we rotate the
top link right and then, we flip the

165
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:15,429
colors. So, this one we used all three of
our operations, rotate left rotate right

166
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:21,468
and flip the colors. And that gets us an
insertion into a tree that has from a tree

167
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:26,930
that i s a single three node to a tree
that is three two nodes that is containing

168
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:34,150
three keys. So that sort of operation is
going to work in a big tree when we insert

169
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,068
into a new three node at the bottom. We do
the standard BST insert, color the new

170
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:45,988
link red, and we do the rotations that we
need, either one or two rotations to

171
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:52,207
balance the temporary four node, and then
we flip colors to pass the red link up one

172
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:58,402
level and then remind me to rotate to that
to make that one lean left. So, for

173
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:05,212
example if we insert h in to this tree
here, it comes off as the left link of R

174
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:11,689
so that gives us a temporary four node
that's not balanced so we need to rotate

175
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,395
the link from S to the right and that
gives us now temporary four node that is

176
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:24,498
balanced and again, these are all local
transformation it's not changing the rest

177
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:31,641
of the tree. Now, we flip colors and that
gives us a, a good red-black tree, except

178
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:37,637
that, that one red link that we just is
leaning the wrong way. So, now we need to

179
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:44,398
rotate left and then once we've done that,
now we have a legal left-leaning red-black

180
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:53,099
tree. So [cough] that's a insertion into a
three node at the bottom. So, here's

181
00:18:53,099 --> 00:19:00,078
another one that involves, remember, we
passed that red link up. There might, if

182
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:07,073
that gets passed up to a three node, then
we have to continue moving up the tree and

183
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:14,059
just treat it in the same way as we just
treated inserting at the bottom. We have a

184
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:21,014
new red link appearing into some three
node. There's the three cases that could

185
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:25,942
happen and here's an, an a, an example.
So, say, we're inserting P into this

186
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:32,489
left-leaning red black tree it goes to the
right event so we get a temporary four

187
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:37,879
node that's got two red links both
children are red in that thing so we want

188
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:43,990
to flip the colors. We flipped the colors
and now our temporary 4-node is up higher

189
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,451
in the tree but it's not balanced so we
are going to have to do two rotations to

190
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:56,199
make that balanced. First one is to make
the bottom link left-leaning and then the

191
00:19:56,199 --> 00:20:01,605
second one is to make the top link
right-leaning so that we can have the

192
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:07,344
temporary four node balance. And then the
last thing we do is flip the colors and

193
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:12,798
now that's the result of that insertion.
It's a bunch of transformations but

194
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,264
they're all simple using our flip colors
or left or right rotation. And [cough]

195
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:23,738
that one happened to be at the root. If
that red link were, were way down in the

196
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:28,762
tree and there were another three node
about it, we might have to do it again.

197
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:34,399
Again, exactly as what would happen in a
2-3 tree. So, let's do a demo of

198
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:42,380
constructing the red-black BST from our
standard set of keys. So, we start with a

199
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,563
single key. Now, if we want to insert E,
if it goes to the left, that's fine.

200
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:56,384
That's a legal left-leaning red-black
tree. A would go to the left of E two

201
00:20:56,384 --> 00:21:02,545
lefts in a row so we have to rotate that
to right. And then we have to flip the

202
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:09,760
colors. And that's a legal red-black BST.
So now, if we insert R into this one then

203
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:16,356
it goes on a red link to the left of X, S
and that's fine, it's a red-black BST. And

204
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:22,764
now, if we insert C into this one, it goes
less than E, greater than A it's a red

205
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:29,330
link connecting A and C but it's leaning
the wrong way. So, we have to do a left

206
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:37,166
rotation, legal-red black BST. And you
want to insert h that goes to the left of

207
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:44,272
R, two reds in a row, rotate the top.
Rotate the top, our temporary four node is

208
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:51,803
balanced, flip colors. Now, we have a
three node, but the red link is leaning

209
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:59,588
right so we have to rotate. And now, we
have a legal red-block BST. Insert x into

210
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:08,020
that one that goes to the right of S, it's
leaning the wrong way, rotate left. Insert

211
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,466
M into this one, goes to the right of h,
leaning the wrong way, rotate left. Most

212
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:21,595
of the operations are simple ones like
this happening at the bottom. Insert P,

213
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:27,246
that goes to the right of M that makes M a
temporary four node that happens to be

214
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:33,459
balanced, so flip the colors. Flip the
colors, now we h ave a temporary four node

215
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:39,504
that's out of balance so we need a double
rotation. First rotate E to make that link

216
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:45,524
point lean to the left, then rotate R to
make the, bring the temporary four node

217
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:52,515
into balance. And then, flip the colors
and that's a legal red-black BST. Insert L

218
00:22:52,515 --> 00:23:00,908
into that one. It goes to the right of H,
leading the wrong way rotate left. [cough]

219
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:08,612
And that's an example of building a
red-black BST from our standard set of

220
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:15,003
keys. Now, we're ready to look at the
implementation for, of the code for

221
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:20,455
inserting into a left-leaning red-black
tree. And the key to understanding this

222
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:26,454
code is to realize that the same code,
code handles all of the cases. And the way

223
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:32,220
that it works is we are always reducing
one case to another. We get this most

224
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,595
complicated case we did a left rotate on
the bottom node and that, that transformed

225
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:43,645
it to this case where they're both leaning
left. And then we did a right rotate on

226
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:48,549
the top node, and that transformed to the
case where our temporary four node is

227
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,526
balanced. And then we flipped colors on
that. So, for a particular insertion, we

228
00:23:54,526 --> 00:24:01,480
can take advantage of this reduce one case
to another by, in, in the way that we're

229
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:09,050
moving in the tree, not to get everything
happen with just a, a few extra lines of

230
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:15,173
code in our standard binary search tree.
So, in gray is our, standard insertion

231
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:23,142
code for binary search trees. And remember
we took some pains to think about the

232
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:29,158
recursive implementation where when we go
down a link we replace that link by

233
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:35,151
whatever the recursive routine gives us
back and that strategy is going to pay off

234
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:41,378
in giving us a really simple code. [cough]
and because in this implementation for

235
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:47,357
left-leaning red-black trees we're going
to return the link whenever we're done,

236
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:53,886
and then that will get that link installed
up in the node above whether it be left or

237
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:59,227
right. Typical implementations of
red-black trees that do not use this

238
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:05,385
recursive strategy wind u p having lots of
cases depending on whether left or right

239
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:11,224
or double rotate to the left or double
rotate to the right can be critical of

240
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:17,253
this code because my own was this way for
the first three editions of the book. And

241
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:22,654
it's only in this edition that we figured
out how to make the code this simple.

242
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:28,593
Okay. So what are the things left to be
done? Let's just check. When we insert a

243
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:35,145
new node all we want to do is create a new
node with the, I've given, associating the

244
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:40,897
given value with a given key, as before
but now we just make that node red. So,

245
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:48,744
that's adding a new node with a red link
at the bottom inserting that into whatever

246
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:56,079
the two or three node it's attached to.
And then we do the comparisons as, as

247
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:03,716
before and that, and that's all fine. Now,
when it's returned then that's the point

248
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:12,534
at which we're going to check whether the
left, the links are leaning to the left as

249
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:20,246
they are suppose to and whether or not
there are any double links or not. So the

250
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:28,441
first thing is if, if is red h.right and
not is red h.left? So, that means H is

251
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:36,519
h.right is red so that means the right
link of H is leaning the wrong way. So, H

252
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,327
is a three node leaning the wrong way. So
we just rotate left H. So, whenever we

253
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:50,274
find a right link, we're sitting on a
right red link we just rotate it left and

254
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:56,328
return that. So, that would be in this
case here, we'd rotate it left and reduce

255
00:26:56,328 --> 00:27:02,172
it to that one. [cough] or in, in you
know, in the case when we're just

256
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:10,227
inserting a new node and it's turns out to
be the right red link attached to a black

257
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:17,724
one, if that handles that case. Now, if
h.left is red and h.left is also red

258
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:25,400
that's this case here where we have two
left-leaning red links. And then in that

259
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,951
case, we just rotate the top one right and
that brings us to this one. So, notice,

260
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:38,018
we're in this case we do this rotation
first, we're on this node and then , that

261
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:43,642
returns and we come up to deal with the
situation on this node after the return,

262
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:49,202
and then we do that rotation. And then
after that rotation, or if there were no

263
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:54,889
rotations at all, if the insertion
happened over here then we'd test and flip

264
00:27:54,889 --> 00:28:00,219
the colors. It's a little mind bending at
first because of the recursive structure

265
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,493
but it won't take you long to convince
yourself that this little bit of extra

266
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:11,438
code completes the implementation of
left-leaning red-black trees. It's quite

267
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:17,738
remarkable, actually. So, let's look at a
visualization. Watching the [unknown],

268
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:23,060
this is a balanced tree getting
constructed in the worst case where

269
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,069
everything that comes in is in ascending
order. A regular binary search tree will

270
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:35,763
just be all strung out in a single line
and wouldn't have quadratic time for this

271
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:41,834
input but a left-leaning red-black tree
actually when, whenever it becomes a power

272
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:47,496
of two is completely balanced as you can
see from this example. Even though they

273
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:53,310
came in, in ascending order, the tree
winds up being perfectly balanced. And

274
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,868
what about descending order. Well, it's
left leaning and the process is a little

275
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:07,312
bit different and sometimes the left path
can get long but not that long. The worse

276
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:14,031
that can happen is that it alternates red
and black. And then after it gets to that

277
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:20,070
worse case it also winds up being
completely balanced when we have a power

278
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,714
of two. Interesting to think just, just
about this case and to prove to yourself

279
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:33,407
that it's always going to be perfectly
balanced when it's descending. And this is

280
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:41,124
just for random insertions. The tree stays
very balanced. It's guaranteed that the

281
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:49,876
longest path which is alternating red and
black can be no more than twice as long as

282
00:29:49,876 --> 00:30:01,409
the shortest path which is all blacks. And
so in this case the longest path is ten

283
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:11,711
and the average path is seven for 255.
Very close to log based two of N. So easy

284
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:20,258
to prove by correspondence with 2-3 trees
that t he height is guaranteed to be less

285
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:27,098
than two log base two N. Every search in
left-leaning red black three is guaranteed

286
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:33,139
to take less than two log base two of N
cuz every path gets the same number of

287
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:39,098
black links so you never have two red
links in a row. [cough] And actually, in

288
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:46,791
typical applications with any kind of
randomness or even if there is a lot of

289
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:54,249
order its difficult to find situations
orders of keys that build the trace of

290
00:30:54,249 --> 00:31:01,076
height is bigger than actually one log N
in, in a real application, its very close

291
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:08,099
to fully balanced all the time. So, that
completes our summary for a symbol table

292
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:15,465
implementations with red-black BSTs. We
have full code it's the regular BST code

293
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:22,044
with the couple of lines adding the calls
and the basic operations. She rotate

294
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:28,431
right, rotate left. In color flip, we
could guarantee logarithmic performance

295
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:35,338
not just research, insert, in delete code.
Delete code is a bit more complicated but

296
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:41,638
it's on the book side and in the book. But
also, since it's the compare-to interface,

297
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:46,048
and since it's a binary tree
representation all the other comparable

298
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:51,732
operations extended operations for ordered
symbol tables are going to be implemented

299
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:56,673
and take time proportional to the log N. A
lot of people ask why use the name

300
00:31:56,877 --> 00:32:02,598
red-black. Well we invented this data
structure this way of looking at balance

301
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:08,390
trees at, at Xerox PARC which was the home
of the personal computer and many other

302
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,071
innovations that we live with today
entering graphic user interface and

303
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:18,099
internet and object oriented programmings
and many other things. But one of the

304
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:24,087
things that was invented there, was the
laser printing and we were very excited to

305
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:30,045
have nearby color laser printer that could
print things out in color and out of the

306
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:35,237
colors, the red looked the best. So,
that's why we picked the color red to

307
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:40,272
distinguish red links the types of links
in three nodes. So, that's an answer to

308
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:45,846
the question for people t hat have been
asking. Now, here's another war story

309
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:52,759
about red-black BSTs. As I mentioned
they're widely used. And there was an

310
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,770
example not that long ago, where a
telephone company contracted with a

311
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:06,105
database provider to build a database that
could store customer information and the

312
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:12,708
provider implemented the database using
red-black BSTs for search and insert. Now,

313
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:18,975
our, our original paper on red black trees
was the way the paper was laid out, it

314
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:25,255
turned out that the delete implementation
happened to be placed after all the

315
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:31,178
references. So, a lot of people didn't see
the delete implementation. And also we

316
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:36,995
didn't have the simple left-leaning
representation. So it was more complicated

317
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:42,933
and involved a lot more cases and so
usually not all the cases were put in the

318
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:48,714
text books. So, people found deletion more
difficult. In fact, that's what lead to

319
00:33:48,714 --> 00:33:54,809
[unknown] analyze the situation then come
up with a left-leaning variant. So, what

320
00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:02,115
they did in this implementation was they
just put in regular Hibbard deletion in

321
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:09,367
the binary search in the red-black BST.
Not the deletion algorithm that's

322
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:17,044
guaranteed to keep the constant black
height all the time. And so but, but they

323
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:24,663
still thought that it should be balanced
and it shouldn't matter much. And they had

324
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:31,480
a complex error recovery process that,
that got triggered if the height limit got

325
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,961
too big. And they rebuild the whole tree
and, and then because of the way they did

326
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:44,401
this deletion, well, the end of the story
was that they had extended the client had

327
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:51,500
extended outage because the implementer
didn't use the full algorithm. And there

328
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:58,356
was a lawsuit and some legal testimony and
I am happy to report that, that it was

329
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:04,413
clear that Hibbard deletion was the
problem once the expert analyzed it and

330
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:11,005
the expert witness, who's a colleague of
mine, said if implemented properly, the

331
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:16,811
height of a red-black BST with N keys is
at most two log N. And so that's the st

332
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:27,474
ory of red-black BST's guaranteed
logarithmic performance for all symbol

333
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:30,043
table operations.
