1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:08,004
Now we'll look at our first implementation
of an algorithm for solving the dynamic

2
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:14,012
connectivity problem, called Quick-find.
This is a so called eager algorithm, for

3
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:20,013
solving kind activity problem. The data
structure that we're going to use to

4
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:25,082
support the algorithm is simply an integer
array indexed by object. The

5
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:31,099
interpretation is the two objects, P and Q
are connected if and only if, their

6
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:39,005
entries in the array are the same. So for
example in this example with our ten

7
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:46,099
objects the idea array that describes the
situation after seven connections is

8
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:53,349
illustrated in the middle of the slide. So
that, after the, at this point zero, five,

9
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:59,578
and six are all in the same connected
component, because they have the same

10
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:05,171
array entry, zero. One, two, and seven all
have entry one. And three, four, eight,

11
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:10,664
and nine all have entry eight. So that
representation is, shows that they're

12
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:16,636
connected. And clearly, that's going to
support a quick implementation of the find

13
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:22,439
operation. We just check the array entries
to see if they're equal. Check if P and Q

14
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,904
have the same ID. So, six and one have
different IDs. One has ID one, six has ID

15
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:34,171
zero. They're not in the same connected
component. Union is more difficult in

16
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:40,981
order to merge the components, containing
two given objects. We have to change all

17
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:47,755
the entries, whose ID is equal to one of
them to the other one. And arbitrarily we

18
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:53,634
choose to change the ones that are the
same as P to the ones that are same as Q.

19
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:58,898
So if we're going to union six and one,
then we have to change entries zero, five,

20
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:04,741
and six. Everybody in the same connected
component as six. From zero to one. And

21
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:10,917
this is, as we'll see, this is a bit of a
problem when we have a huge number of

22
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:16,927
objects, because there's a lot of values
that can change. But still, it's easy to

23
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:23,263
implement, so that'll be our starting
point. So we'll start with a, a demo of

24
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:31,189
how this works. So, initially, we set up
the ID array, with each entry, equal to

25
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:37,932
its index. And so all that says is that
all the objects are independent. They're

26
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:43,918
in their own connected component. Now,
when we get a union operation. So, say,

27
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:49,694
four is supposed to be unio n with three.
Then we're going to change, all entries,

28
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:56,190
whose ID is equal to the first ID to the
second one. So in this case, we'll change

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,061
the, connect three and four means that we
need to change the four to a three. And

30
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:10,259
we'll continue to do a few more so you'll
get an idea of how it works. So three and

31
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,657
eight now so to connect three and eight
now three and four have to be connected to

32
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:19,950
eight. So both of those entries have to
change to eight. Okay? So now, what about

33
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,026
six and five? So again, we change the
first one to match the second one. So to

34
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:32,332
connect six and five, we change the six to
a five. What about nine and four? So, now

35
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:39,789
we have to change the, to connect nine and
four, we have to change, 9's entry to be

36
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:45,325
the same as 4's. So now we have three,
four, eight, and nine. All have entries

37
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:52,365
eight. They're all on the same connected
component. Two and one means that we

38
00:03:52,365 --> 00:04:00,013
connect two and one by changing the 2201.
Eight and nine are already connected. They

39
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:06,660
have the same, entries in the idea array.
So, that connected query, that find says,

40
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,096
true, they're already connected. And five
and zero have different entries. They're

41
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:21,780
not connected, so we'd return false, in
that case, not connected. And then, if we

42
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:31,617
want to connect five and zero. Then, as
usual we'll connect, the entry

43
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:39,855
corresponding to both five and six to
zero. Seven and two, union seven and two.

44
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:49,623
That's an easy one. And union, six and one
so there is three entries that have to get

45
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:57,899
changed. All those zeros have to get
changed to ones. So, that's a quick demo

46
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:04,126
of Quick-find. Now next we'll look at the
code for implementating that. Okay, with

47
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:10,628
this concrete demo in mind then moving to
coding up this algorithim is pretty

48
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:16,518
straight forward. Although it's an
interesting programming exercise that a

49
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:23,312
lot of us would get wrong the first time.
So let's start with the constructor, well

50
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:29,125
we have a, a private integer array. That's
our ID array. That's the data structure

51
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,953
that's going to support this
implementation. The constructor has to

52
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:40,637
create the array and then go through and
set the value corresponding to each index

53
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:47,200
I to I. That's straight forward. The find
operation, or connected operation. That's

54
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,024
the easy one . This is the Quick-find
algorithm. So it simply takes its two

55
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:58,552
arguments, P and Q, and checks whether
their ID entries are equal, and returns

56
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:04,077
that value. If they're equal, it returns
true. If they're not equal, it returns

57
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:09,942
false. The more complicated operation
implement is a union. And there, we find

58
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:15,803
first the ID corresponding with the first
argument, and then the ID corresponding to

59
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:21,018
the second argument. And then we go
through the whole array, and looking for

60
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:27,068
the entries whose IDs are equal to the ID
of the first argument, and set those to

61
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:32,565
the ID of the second argument. That's a
pretty straightforward implementation. And

62
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:38,156
I mentioned that a lot of us would get us
wrong. The mistake we might make is to put

63
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:43,660
ID of P here rather than first picking
out, that value. And you can think about

64
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,672
the implications of that. That's an
insidious bug. So, that's a fine

65
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:54,900
implementation of QuickFind so the next
thing to decide is how effective or

66
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,152
efficient that algorithm is going to be
and we'll talk in some detail about how to

67
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:07,088
do that but for this it's sufficient to
just think about the number of times the

68
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:12,901
code has to access the array. As we saw
when doing the implementation, both the

69
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:19,019
initialized and union operations involved
the for-loop that go through the entire

70
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,469
array. So they have to touch in a constant
proportional to n times after touching

71
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:32,155
array entry. Find Operation is quick, it's
just to a constant number of times check

72
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:37,829
array entries. And this is problematic
because the union operation is too

73
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:45,708
expensive. In particular if you just have
N union commands on N objects which is

74
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:52,515
not unreasonable. They're either connected
or not then that will take quadratic time

75
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:58,458
in squared time. And one of the themes
that we'll go through over and over in

76
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:04,531
this course is that quadratic time is much
to slow. And we can't accept quadratic

77
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:10,796
time algorithms for large problems. The
reason is they don't scale. As computers

78
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:16,305
get faster and bigger, quadratic
algorithms actually get slower. Now, let's

79
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:22,464
just talk roughly about what I mean by
that. A very rough standard, say for now,

80
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:29,206
is that people have computers that can run
billions of operations per second, and

81
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:34,815
they have billions of entries in main
memory. So, that means that you could

82
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,916
touch everything in the main memory in
about a second. That's kind of an amazing

83
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:46,907
fact that this rough standard is really
held for 50 or 60 years. The computers get

84
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:52,735
bigger but they get faster so to touch
everything in the memory is going to take

85
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,403
a few seconds. Now it's true when
computers only have a few thousand words

86
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:04,657
of memory and it's true now that they have
billions or more. So let's accept that as

87
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:11,873
what computers are like. Now, that means
is that, with that huge memory, we can

88
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:17,712
address huge problems. So we could have,
billions of objects, and hope to do

89
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:23,608
billions of union commands on them. And,
but the problem with that quick find

90
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:29,770
algorithm is that, that would take
ten^18th operations, or, say array axises

91
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,098
or touching memory. And if you do the
math, that works out to 30 some years of

92
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:42,033
computer time. Obviously, not practical to
address such a problem on today's

93
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:48,057
computer. And, and the reason is, and the
problem is that quadratic algorithms don't

94
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:54,097
scale with technology. You might have a
new computer that's ten times as fast but

95
00:09:54,097 --> 00:10:00,033
you could address a problem that's ten
times as big. And with a quadratic

96
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:06,028
algorithm when you do that. It's going to
be ten times as slow. That's the kind of

97
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:11,048
situation we're going to try to avoid by
developing more efficient algorithms for

98
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,020
solving problems like this.
