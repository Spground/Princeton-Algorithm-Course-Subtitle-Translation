1
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:07,064
Now we're going to take a look at what
happens when we have significant numbers

2
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:12,050
of duplicate keys which is not at all
unusual in practical applications. So, in,

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,084
in fact, often, the purpose of a sort is
to bring items with equal keys together

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:23,039
for like the example that I gave where we
had cities and time. There's a lot of

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,375
detailed data and the time and maybe the
whole goal of the sort is to group them by

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:33,880
cities so we can ship out the data for
each city, to each city and there's plenty

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,000
of other examples like that in data
processing where we find maybe remove

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,096
duplicates from a mailing list or all the
job applicants that we get, we might want

9
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:51,776
to sort them by the college attendant. So
the sort does huge files with huge numbers

10
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:57,089
of duplicate keys. So, a sort, it's
worthwhile to take a careful look at what

11
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:02,482
the implication of that is. So again,
typical characteristics we have a huge

12
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:09,497
file but small number of different key
values. So let's look at our algorithms in

13
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:15,923
that situation. So Mergesort, it doesn't
matter that much what the key values are

14
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:22,425
like and it's actually, we can show that
Mergesort always uses between one-half, N

15
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:29,679
log N and N log N compares. Quicksort
actually, they're up until the 1990s the

16
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:35,550
most widely used implementation took
quadratic time. For files with large

17
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,985
numbers of equal keys and that was
actually found by applications user and,

18
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:46,988
and that's the standard Quicksort that was
in all the textbooks almost all the

19
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:53,872
textbooks if you did not stop the
partitioning on equal keys it would run in

20
00:01:53,872 --> 00:02:00,710
quadratic time. So we want to do better
than this. So the mistake happens if we

21
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,130
put all the items equal to the
partitioning item on one side which is a

22
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,996
natural way to implement it and the
consequence is if you have all the keys

23
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:19,147
equal, then partitioning doesn't really do
anything. You just peels off one key to do

24
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:25,423
file size n then you get a sub file size n
- one and then n - two and so forth and

25
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:30,732
the result is a quadratic tim e algorithm.
Our implementation, we stopped the

26
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:35,882
partitioning scans on items equal to the
partitioning item and then in that case,

27
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:40,548
when all the keys are equal, it's going to
divide it exactly in the middle. And then

28
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:43,875
in that case, when all the keys are equal,
it's going to divide at exactly in the

29
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,843
middle. And then in that case you get an N
log N compares. But actually when you

30
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:51,425
think about it, why don't we just put all
the items equal to the partitioning item

31
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:56,642
in place. That's, that's really a
desirable way to look at it and let's take

32
00:02:56,642 --> 00:03:01,114
a look at that option. So the goal is so
called three way partitioning. So what we

33
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,772
want to do is get the array into three
parts so then now we have two pointers

34
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:10,364
into the middle. One that is the boundary
between the keys that are less than the

35
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:15,318
partitioning element and those that are
equal of the partitioning element. Another

36
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,469
one that's the boundary between the keys
that are equal of partitioning elements

37
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,245
and the one that is greater. And then in
the middle are all the equal keys and

38
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:30,464
that's what we'd like to arrange. Now
until the 1990s, conventional wisdom among

39
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:36,842
people implementing system was, wasn't
worth doing this. But, but actually it's a

40
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:43,893
problem that Edsger Dijkstra had proposed
in the 70s as an example of, of

41
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:50,050
programming problem. He was really
interested in analyzing correctness of

42
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:57,034
programs and showing that this how you
could convince yourself that this program

43
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:03,717
was operating as expected. But in the
1990s we figured out that really this was

44
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:10,624
going to be an effective way to sort. And
this was taking a look at the Qsort that a

45
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:17,431
user found was broken and, and now, this
method is incorporated into some plenty of

46
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:23,052
system sorts. So let's take a look at how
it works with the demo its more

47
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:28,548
complicated than standard Quicksort
partitioning. A bit more complicated

48
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:34,507
because there's more to do. So now we have
our i pointer which is right to the left

49
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:40,112
of stuff we haven't seen ye t and then, we
have two other pointers that maintain,

50
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:46,069
maintain these boundaries everything to
the right of gt is known to be greater

51
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:52,572
than partitioning element. Everything to
the left of lt is known to be less and

52
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:59,932
between lt and i is known to be equal. And
all the method does is maintain this in

53
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:07,709
variants so let's do an example or two and
see how that works. So we increment i and

54
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:14,939
then figure out what to do. So, now it's
less than the partitioning element. So,

55
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,197
what we want to do is increment lt's. So
now we have one that's definitely less

56
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:28,309
than the partitioning element and lt is,
is pointing at the partitioning element.

57
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:34,057
And so now in, increment both lt and i so
that's the first case there. So now we

58
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:39,077
have a second item b. That's less than the
partitioning element so exchange with lt

59
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:44,084
and increment them both. So, we're moving
the smaller ones than the partitioning

60
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:49,097
element to the left of lt and keeping lt
pointing on a partitioning element. Now,

61
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:54,079
what about when we get one that's greater
than the partitioning elements? So, in

62
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,086
that case, we exchange greater the one
over at the right with i and decrement gt.

63
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:04,093
So now, we have one over to the right that
we know is greater than the partitioning

64
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:09,797
element. Notice that we didn't increment i
because that element z that is over in the

65
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:14,784
right, really hasn't been compared to the
partitioning element yet. But we did

66
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:21,107
decrement gt so we made progress. So now
what happens here, now i is pointing to a

67
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:28,730
bigger one so we're going to exchange it
with the one at gt and decrement gt again.

68
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:35,068
And again, y is bigger, so exchange it,
decrement gt. Now we have the c, that one

69
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:41,878
smaller so that's the first case. So we'll
move it to the left of lt and increment

70
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:48,187
both lt and i. W is a bigger one, let us
to go over to the right. Now we have i

71
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:53,509
pointing to an element that's equal to the
partitioning element. And what are we

72
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,109
supposed to do then? Well, to maintain the
variant there we just need to increment i.

73
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:04,263
And again it 's pointing to one that's
equal of partitioning element increment i.

74
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:09,387
And now one more time and now it's
pointing to one that's greater so we

75
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:15,025
exchange that with gt and decrement gt and
i is pointing to the one that was there

76
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:20,375
and that ones smaller. So we exchange it
will lt and increment both i and lt and

77
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:25,392
now where the point, where the pointers
have crossed i and gt across there's

78
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:31,296
nothing that we haven't examined yet. So,
our partitioning is complete. Here's a

79
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:37,676
trace of Dijkstra 3-way partitioning for
his problem which is when there's just

80
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:44,315
three different values in the file. Our
problem we were treating partitioning,

81
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:51,051
equal of partitioning element as one value
less than as another and greater than as

82
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:56,090
another. And so this, this trace
illustrates how we always make some

83
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:04,816
progress and eventually we get the file
sorted. The implementation is amazingly

84
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:11,525
simple. The whole partitioning process for
three-way partitioning and the modern

85
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:18,380
programming language like Java simply
maintains the invariances described in the

86
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,882
demo. If we find one that's less we
exchange i and lt and increment them both.

87
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:31,207
If it's greater we exchange i and gt and
decrement that. Otherwise, we increment i.

88
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:37,137
Could, could hardly be simpler. In fact,
is simpler in many ways than these

89
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:44,091
standard implementation of Quicksort. In
fact, there's an argument for just using

90
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:51,816
this implementation of Quicksort and
forgetting about horse because it performs

91
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:59,022
so well in so many practical situations.
Here's a visual trace of 3-way Quicksort

92
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:05,882
for situation with plenty of equal keys.
And again, when there's a lot of equal

93
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:12,853
keys then there's going to be place where
one of those is chosen, it's partitioning

94
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:19,661
element then a big chunk of the array gets
handled just in a partitioning process.

95
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:28,062
Now, there's actually some deeper reasons
why this method is important and one thing

96
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:33,816
to do is to realize that the lower bound
that we talked about before depended on

97
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:40,062
the keys being distinct. So, worst case
for lower bounds is when the keys are all

98
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:46,094
distinct. But if we have a situation where
there are a lot of equal keys, that model

99
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:52,793
is wrong. It's not too difficult to get a
similar lower bound for the model when we

100
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:59,028
know that there are some equal keys. So,
for example this is a rather complicated

101
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:05,008
formula but not too bad but in a sense
that if you know that the i-th key, it

102
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:10,767
occurs xi times you can write down a lower
bound for the number of comparisons that

103
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:16,711
are going to be required in the worst
case. And, what's interesting about three

104
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:22,718
way partitioning is that the number of
compares that it uses is equal to this

105
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:29,141
lower bound within a constant factor. So
that's entropy-optimal and what that means

106
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:34,712
is whatever the distribution of equal keys
in there, this thing is going to use a

107
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:40,928
number of compares that's proportional to
the best that you could possibly do. The

108
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:47,266
proof for this fact is quite beyond the
scope of this course but it's still an

109
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:53,275
important fact. And the, the bottom line
is that if you randomize the order and use

110
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:59,252
three-way partitioning then there's lot of
applications where your sort routine is

111
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:05,478
going to be linear not N log N so it will
be much more faster than Mergesort and you

112
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:11,594
know, the methods for really a broad class
of applications. So, taking a look at

113
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:23,860
equal keys is carefully is something that
can lead us to very efficient Quicksort
