1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:07,022
Okay. Those are some basic data structures
and implementations and it seem quite

2
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:13,011
elementary and simple but actually right
away we can get to some very sophisticated

3
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:18,085
applications of these basic concepts and
that's what we're going to consider next.

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:27,076
Now, first thing to mention is that often
the kinds of data types and data

5
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:33,668
structures that we implement or found in a
Java library. So, that's true in many

6
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:40,698
programming environments. So, for example
stacks and queues you can find those words

7
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:46,728
mentioned in the Java library so there's a
Java collection library and the so-called

8
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:53,203
List interface which is displayed here. So
Java has general API for sequences of

9
00:00:53,203 --> 00:01:00,099
items and its got things like a, append at
the end, remove from the beginning, and

10
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:07,611
so forth. Any uses of the resizing array,
so many of the principles that we consider

11
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:15,075
does also a, a link list interface. So,
why not just use those? Why use our own

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:22,901
implementations? Well, the problem is
often in such library code is kind of

13
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:32,367
designed by committee phenomenon that more
and more operations get added and the API

14
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:39,679
becomes too broad or bloated. It's not a
good idea to have lots and lots of, you

15
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:47,019
know, operations in the same API. And
we'll see example in a second. The

16
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:53,427
problem, the real problem is that when you
do that you can't know much about the

17
00:01:53,427 --> 00:02:01,347
performance or you can't assume much about
the performance. And so you can kind of

18
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:06,949
immediately arrive at that performance
even for simple clients. So our best

19
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:12,918
practice that we recommend is so few that
these basic data structures that we use

20
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:18,467
and there's so simple is to go ahead and
use the implementations that we've just

21
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:24,233
discussed for these fundamental data
structures. Maybe later, later on, after

22
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:30,745
an experienced programmer who knows what
he or she is doing could use some of these

23
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:36,767
library collections effectively. But
inexperienced programmers often have

24
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:43,793
trouble with it. Here's a war story from
students Programming assignments not that

25
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:50,211
long ago. So, we have an assignment where
you need to generate a random open sites

26
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:55,969
in a percolation system. We have one
student who was paying attention to what

27
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:01,677
we're saying and uses an array and can
pick the indices into that array at random

28
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:07,737
check whether they're open and, and
repeat. And so the array is N by N, it's

29
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:13,955
N^2 things and it takes about N^2 time,
which is actually a linear time for this

30
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:20,113
application. But then we have another
student who had some Java before coming to

31
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:25,247
us and considered himself an expert and
said, well, I'm going to use linked list

32
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:31,615
because I could use Java's library and I
don't have to worry about downloading your

33
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:38,121
stupid code. And so, I'll just use that
one and pick an index at random and delete

34
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:44,094
and that program took quadratic time and
poor Kenny, when trying to run his program

35
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:50,806
for the huge instance that we asked found
out that it wasn't finishing. And the

36
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:59,050
reason is that the Java linked list
implementation takes a linear time to find

37
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:06,456
an item with a given index. Not constant
time like an array. And that's difficult

38
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:12,800
for Kenny to think about and difficult to
drive that information from the

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,055
implementation so program is just too
slow. And with the Swiss knife

40
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:25,623
implementation with so many operations
it's hard to know whether or not the

41
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:30,682
particular set of operations that your
client needs is efficiently implemented. So

42
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:38,444
our insistence in this course is that
students should not use the library until

43
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:44,551
we've implemented it in class. At least
that some indication that you understand

44
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:50,546
the performance characteristics. So now,
let's look at some applications then of,

45
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:56,976
of stacks. There's the stacks are really
actually fundamental underlying

46
00:04:56,976 --> 00:05:03,716
computation because they implement ,
recursion and so, you use stacks often

47
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:09,860
everyday when you wrote, use the Back
button in the Web browser, the places that

48
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,496
you've been are saved on a stack. Right
now we will look at two examples. One,

49
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:22,377
having to deal with compiling from a
programming language or interpreting into

50
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:28,544
an actual computation and then the other
one is the PostScript language which is

51
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:35,249
widely used for, for printing and
publishing. So, so the way the compilers

52
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:41,524
implement functions is using stacks. When
there's a function call the whole local

53
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:48,198
environment is pushed and then along with
the return address and then the function

54
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:53,623
returned is pop the return address in the
local environment. So there is the stack

55
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:58,917
there that contains all that information
and whether the function calls itself or

56
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:04,119
not is not relevant. The stack contains
the recursion. In fact, you can always use

57
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:09,929
an explicit stack to make a recursive
program non-recursive. So, this is so when

58
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:16,011
we have the GCD function, computing the
greatest common denominator, greatest

59
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:23,402
common denominator p and q is greatest
common denominator of q and p mod q and it

60
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:30,425
just calls itself until q gets to be zero.
And as this graphic integrates, it just

61
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:37,849
does it by saving the information on a
stack. Now a specific example that really

62
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:47,568
shows this off and also will illustrate
the utility of being able to process

63
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:53,472
multiple types of data with the same code
is this example is Dijkstra's two-stack

64
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:58,576
algorithm for arithmetic expression
evaluation. So the goal is, you got an

65
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:03,601
arithmetic expression this is just
actually like a simple stand in for a

66
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:08,398
program and we'll talk about that in a
second but let's say, arithmetic

67
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:13,936
expressions. We have operands and
operators and you want to evaluate it. And

68
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:19,897
Dijkstra's algorithm is very simple to
express. You processes through the

69
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:25,485
expression from left to right. If you see
a value, you put it, you maintain two

70
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:31,232
stacks and if you see a value, you put it
on the value stack and if you see an

71
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:37,117
operator, you put on the operator stack.
Left parenthesis you ignore. Right

72
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:43,584
parenthesis, you pop the operator and two
values and push the result. Now that's a

73
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:51,334
lot of words let's look at a demo. So we
start out with the empty value stack and

74
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:57,476
operator stack and we're going to move
from left to right. So, and those are the

75
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:04,319
a top is summarize the four type of things
that we could wind up with and what to do

76
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,608
so the left parenthesis we've ignored, a
value we put on to the value stack. So,

77
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:14,985
that one goes right in to the value stack.
Operator, we put on to the operator stack.

78
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:20,066
And plus it goes on the operator stack.
Left parenthesis you ignore. It seems strange

79
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,568
to be ignoring parenthesis and we'll get
back to that in a second. Value, put in

80
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:29,677
the value stack. Operator, put on the
operating stack. Doesn't seem like we're

81
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:35,062
doing much except putting stuff on stacks
and now, when we come to our right

82
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:40,322
parenthesis and that's when it gets
interesting. What it says is to you have

83
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:45,573
the top operator and the top two values
and that's what you want to do. Supply

84
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:52,136
that operator to those values and put the
resulting value that you get back on to the

85
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:57,758
operation stack. So, we take off the top
two things, we do the operation and then we

86
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:05,024
put the thing that we get onto the value
stack. And that's right parenthesis. So

87
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:14,720
now continuing along we put a star on.
Left parenthesis, we ignore. Four on, star.

88
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:21,088
The right goes to the value stack and now
we got a lot of stuff on the stacks and we

89
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:25,971
got through right parenthesis and that's
going to finish up the computation, take

90
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:30,530
the top two items off the stack and the
top operator off the operator stack,

91
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,400
perform the operation, put the result
back on the value stack. Another right

92
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,392
parenthesis, take the top two values off.
Perform the operation. Put the value on to

93
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:45,696
the value stack and finally, the last
right parenthesis, take the two operators

94
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:51,508
of the value stack, operators of the value
stack, and operator of the operator stack,

95
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:56,874
perform the operation, put the result back
on the value stack. And we're at the end

96
00:09:56,874 --> 00:10:06,352
of the computation and that's the result.
The value that arithmetic expression is

97
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:19,447
101. Okay? Yup. Here's the code that
implements Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm.

98
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:26,915
We have two different stacks. The operand
stack the operator stack is string, it

99
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:32,962
could be characters which is just our
operator. Then our value stack is doubled

100
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:39,034
so that's the same stack code but with
generics, we're using, using two different

101
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:44,492
types of data. And then simply perform
Dijkstra's algorithm. If we have a left

102
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:50,397
parenthesis... Read a new string. If we have
a left parenthesis, do nothing. If we have

103
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:57,089
plus or times, push it. If we have a right
parenthesis, then go ahead and pop the

104
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:05,216
operator. And if it's plus, add the result
of the two values at the top of the value

105
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:13,757
stack and if it's a star, multiply the two
values on the top of the stack and, and

106
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:20,392
then push the result. So and then when
you're done then simply print out the

107
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:26,749
value on the stack and that's a fine and
elegant implementation using stacks for

108
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:33,027
any arithmetic expression. And it's easy
to extend that to handle other types of

109
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:40,754
things and so, why does this work? Well,
when the algorithm encounters an operator,

110
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:46,910
say, in the inside, we got the parenthesis,
operand, operator, operand, parenthesis

111
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:53,697
its easy to see that what its going to do
inside there is put the at the top of the

112
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:59,647
stack whatever it is, is to put the two
and three on the top of the value stack

113
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:05,534
and plus on the top of the operating stack
and when it hits that right parenthesis,

114
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:11,089
it's going to perform the operation and
it's going to proceed then exactly as if

115
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:17,064
the original input where that, where the
value replaced. So, just go in from the

116
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:23,314
inside out for every operation enclosed
within parenthesis like that it's just

117
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:29,169
repeat the argument that's exactly as if
the original expression were (one + five)

118
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:34,981
twenty and then again, replacing that one,
one + 100, 101. That's, that's why

119
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:41,487
Dijkstra's algorithm works. Actually
fairly easy to understand why it works.

120
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:48,066
And you can go ahead and extend this
algorithm to add functions like logs and

121
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:54,376
sines or other operators and have
precedence among operators, have them

122
00:12:54,376 --> 00:13:01,602
associate and multiple operations, and so
forth. And actually that's on the road to

123
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:08,720
developing a compiler or a way to
translate a, a program from a programming

124
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,585
language to a computation, so
Dijkstra's algorithm that uses stack is

125
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:25,072
one way for entering and understanding of
the basis of computation.
