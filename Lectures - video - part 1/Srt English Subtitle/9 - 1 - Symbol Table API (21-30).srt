00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,074
Welcome back. In this and the next few
lectures, we're going to look at symbol

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:11,091
tables. A fundamental and extremely
important data type that have led to all

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:17,050
kinds of fascinating implementations and
we're going to see at several of them in

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,027
this course. To begin, we'll take a look
at the API and some elementary

5
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:27,051
implementations and various operations
that people want to perform on Symbol

6
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:33,028
Tables. Start with the API. The idea
behind symbol tables is to implement the

7
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:39,067
following abstraction. We are going to
have keys, like our keys in priority

8
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:45,089
queues but, the whole ideas that we are
going want to associate, values with each

9
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:51,001
key. So two operations that we're going to
perform in symbol tables is the insert

10
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:56,000
operation where we're really putting a
value, a key value pair into the symbol

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,099
table, a value with a specified key, and
then given a key we want to search for a

12
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:06,037
corresponding value. Those are the two
basic operations. Now the keys and the

13
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:12,089
values can interchange roles. And that's,
that's why we, have the abstraction to

14
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:19,033
separate them. So for example, a domain
name server might have a look up where

15
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:26,008
you've got a table that's got an IP
address, and a URL associated with that IP

16
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:32,060
address. And different clients might want
to use this data in different ways. One

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,080
might want to use the URL as key. Given
the URL, give us the corresponding IP. The

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,018
address. Another client, might want to use
the IP address as key, have an IP address,

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,064
give me the corresponding client. So those
are just a couple of examples. This is a

20
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:58,042
very fundamental and basic abstraction. In
the list of applications is huge, in fact

21
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:05,061
almost any computer application system is
going to have symbol table or multiple

22
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:12,072
symbol tables at its core, all the way
down to the basic memory system of the

23
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:19,752
computer or the networking system that
your computer accessed information depends

24
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:26,083
on. You can think of it intuitively, as,
like a dictionary. Well, there used to be

25
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:31,025
books, and people would open up those
books to look for a word, to find the

26
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:37,090
definition. Nowadays, you're more likely,
to do that online. Or, when you're trying

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,582
to find a song to download, you provide
the name of the song. And then a value

28
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:48,005
will tell you what computer to go to, to
get that or in commercial computing, the

29
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:53,186
key might be an account number, and the
value might be the transaction details,

30
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:58,304
for that account. Web search is something,
we all do multiple times every day. And

31
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:02,628
the key is a keyword, or a list of
keywords. And the value is a list of

32
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:08,128
places where that keyword is found. And
there's many, many other applications,

33
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:15,623
including scientific applications where
say in genomics people use simple tables

34
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:23,166
to keep track of finding markers in the
genome and again many other applications.

35
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:29,694
So, its a very fundamental concept and we
will look at plenty of applications. But

36
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:36,532
first we want to look at some algorithms
so the way that it's convenient to set up

37
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:42,180
a symbol table is to implement the
so-called associative array abstraction.

38
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:50,206
And the idea behind that is to think about
just associating one value with each key.

39
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,235
And well it's like in Java array of
integers say. We're only, our keys in that

40
00:03:57,235 --> 00:04:02,930
case are indices that are restricted
between, to be between zero and the array

41
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,954
size. But we're only associating one value
with each index. We think of storing the

42
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:16,443
value in the array position given by that
index. And a good way to think of a symbol

43
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:23,091
table is as shown in the right here. When
we put a key value pair onto the symbol

44
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:28,451
table. Think of that as using the key to
index an array, and storing the value

45
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:34,461
there. Now this, isn't legal in Java if
key is not an int. And, and we're going to

46
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:40,389
do this generic. It can be any type of
data. But, it's a good way to think about

47
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:46,832
it. And then, to retrieve it, you just
give that same key, and it'll return the

48
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:52,362
value. So that's our, two primary
operations. Put a key value pair into the

49
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:59,569
table. So that is associate the value with
key, and then get the value paired with

50
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:07,399
the key. Now th ere's particular rules for
Null that I'll talk about in a second. And

51
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:15,291
then to properly maintain the symbol table
in a dynamic situation in many clients you

52
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:23,179
want to support and delete operation and
contains is, is simpler operation than

53
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:29,220
depth. It's convenient for many clients
where it just tells us whether there's

54
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,018
some value paired with that key in the
table isn't in size. And then another

55
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:41,092
thing that you might want to do is iterate
through all the keys in, in the table. So

56
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:46,656
those are the basic operations that we're
going to want to implement to get the

57
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:52,740
associative array abstraction. And then
there's many, many possibilities for

58
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,148
clients and we'll look at some later on.
Now there is a couple of conventions

59
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:06,101
around null. And these are not critical,
but they make it bit more convenient for

60
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:11,689
several implementations. So we are not
going to allow null values, we cannot

61
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:18,836
associate null with any key. And then we
are going to adopt the convention that the

62
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:25,407
get method returns null, if the key is not
present in the table. And also the

63
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:31,890
associative array abstraction is the put
method, well, overwrite an old value with

64
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,022
a new value. So these are our
consequences. So, it's, the contains

65
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:43,032
implementation is the same for all our,
symbol typal implementations. If get

66
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:49,051
returns, a non null value, then there's a
value corresponding to that key in the

67
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:56,295
table if it returns null. It's not get
returns null keys not present. And the

68
00:06:56,295 --> 00:07:02,021
other thing that we could do is we can use
null in some situations or temporary

69
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:09,052
situations to implement a lazy version of
the delete operation. We can associate the

70
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:15,480
key with null internally and then a client
won't know the difference whether that's

71
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,179
in there or not. And some algorithms take
advantage of the ability to use null in

72
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:27,030
this way. These are just conventions and
somewhat details but it's important to

73
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,764
point them out at front. So now, we're
going to want the value to be any generic

74
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:37,817
type at all, but the key type we have to
make some natural assumptions about them.

75
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:42,957
And actually there's different assumptions
that we make in our implementations

76
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:47,766
depending on the application. Though one
of the most useful ones is to have

77
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:53,277
comparable keys. Just as in sorting
algorithms we'll assume that the keys have

78
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:58,806
values that have come from a total order.
And we can use compare to, to compare

79
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:04,542
whether one key is less than, than other
or not. This is for two reasons. One is we

80
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:10,623
can get more efficient app implementations
if we can use the ordering of the keys to

81
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:16,191
help us find our way around the data
structure. And the other reason is that we

82
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:22,021
can support a broader set of simple table
operations that are very convenient for

83
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:28,044
many clients. And it's very typical for
keys to come from an ordered set. Now, for

84
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:33,660
example in the dictionary application or
if keys are stings or numbers. Or account

85
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,539
numbers or many other situations. So if
they're going to be comparable we might as

86
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,419
well take advantage of it. Both to get
more efficient algorithms and to be able

87
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,165
to take advantage of a broader set of
operations. Now in other situations, maybe

88
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:55,930
they're not comparable. And all we're
allowed to use is to, use the equals

89
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,608
operation. That is everything every type
of data in Java has to support and equals

90
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:07,581
operation that reads out to test whether
they're equal. And there's another family

91
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:15,694
of methods where there's no ordering. Then
there is a special method called hash code

92
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:23,219
that helps us [cough] inject randomness
into the process and that's built into

93
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:28,484
Java and also some classic algorithms
depend on that. We're going to start out

94
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:34,855
with the comparable mostly. And again, as
with priority queues, the best practice is

95
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:41,073
to use immutable types, and experienced
programmers know this and it's not

96
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:48,059
difficult to arrange for the natural types
of data that people are going to use for

97
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:54,097
simple table keys. Unreasonable to expect
the implementation to work well if the

98
00:09:54,097 --> 00:10:01,051
client can change the values of keys that
are in the table. If you want that, you

99
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:07,007
have to provide that as a specific
operation. In the case of symbol tables ,

100
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:12,015
we are not going to do that. You have to
remove it and put it back in. Alright, so

101
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:18,781
there's equalities. Now, equality again
we're getting into programming language

102
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:24,998
issue but it's still it's important to be
explicit about what's going on with,

103
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:30,705
equality. How do we test if two objects
are equal? So, the job has got

104
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:39,653
requirements as for compared to in, here's
the basic requirements about equals. There

105
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:47,378
is a method that all Java for equals, but
the default implementation is simply to

106
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:54,776
test whether the references are equal. Are
those precisely the same objects or not.

107
00:10:54,776 --> 00:11:00,734
Usually in applications when we want to
have something more general than that and

108
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:05,861
have a concept of a value or like a key in
our case. And then we want to know if two

109
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:11,272
references refer to objects that have the
same value and we want to call that equal,

110
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:16,704
that's what equals is about. So anyway
we're required to make sure that X is

111
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:23,128
always equal to X and that, X = Y is the
same Y = X, and if X = Y, Y = Z, then X =

112
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:29,031
Z. So that means that mathematical terms
equals is called an equivalence relation.

113
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:38,105
And also no, no object is equal to null.
So those are absolute requirements for

114
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:44,809
Java. And again, the default
implementation is to check whether they

115
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:49,719
refer to the same object. And that's
rarely what we want. Java systems programs

116
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:55,429
maybe want that. But client programs
usually have customized implementations

117
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:01,588
that are based on comparing some sort of
value and the standard built-in types of

118
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,707
the Java language are going to have those
customized implementations and we can rely

119
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:12,045
on them doing what we expect. If we're
going to implement our own types and then

120
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:18,067
use those types as keys and symbol tables
you have to exercise a little bit of care

121
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:24,450
and we'll talk about that briefly. Say we
have this simplified date implementation

122
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,144
we talked about before it's a mutable type
and every day it's got a month a day in a

123
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:36,994
year. It seems like it should be easy to
implement equals basically, we're just

124
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:43,116
going to check that all the significant
fields are the same. Two dates should be

125
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:49,055
equal if they have the same day, month,
and year. And if any one of those are not

126
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:55,518
the same value, then just return false. So
that seems as if it should work. But that

127
00:12:55,518 --> 00:13:02,403
doesn't have all the characteristics that
we need in a job implementation. And so

128
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:08,494
all of this code in red shows a model for
what you might do if you're going to

129
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:15,475
implement your own type of data equals for
your own type of data. So we shouldn't use

130
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:22,546
it in connection with inheritance so we
don't use inheritance that much so I won't

131
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:28,803
talk about that The type of the argument
in the equals must be object, do you think

132
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:34,783
it should be date? And experts debate
about that, and people who are interested

133
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:40,778
can look on the web for that kind of date.
If it is the case that you happen to be

134
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:45,970
testing two objects that are the same
object for equality, you might as well,

135
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,959
optimize everything and just test that. If
Y is a reference that's pointing to the

136
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,485
same object as this object just returned
true because, if you're going to test the

137
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:01,532
values they're going to have the same
values anyway. And that's a good

138
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:06,775
optimization for lots of, situations. Why
go through all that risk to that code if

139
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:12,646
you know right away they're, equal.
There's this test for null, that has to be

140
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:18,065
there. And if not there can lead to
nefarious plugs and, and, unusual

141
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:23,278
problems. So on your equals test you'd
better, test that, the client didn't give

142
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,274
you null. They have to be in the same
class. And while there's a couple of

143
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:33,964
different ways to check about the same
class, and that's another religious

144
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:40,725
debate. That we'll ignore. We'll use, get
class and that's something that's got to

145
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:45,749
work or they'll get, they'll get an
exception in this later code. Because

146
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:51,491
since Y had to be an object, now we have
to, cast it to a date. And then it better

147
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:57,553
be the right class, or else it's not going
to have these fields, that, we can test

148
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:04,078
for. So, details but anyway, you can use
this code as a model to implement equals

149
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:10,741
for any data type that you might wind up
using as a simple table key. Okay so

150
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:17,227
that's a standard this is just in words
the standard recipe for user find, type

151
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:23,215
optimize for reference equality, check
against null. Make sure they're the same

152
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:28,893
type and do the casting, and then compare
all the similar, significant fields. It

153
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:34,895
could be that if one of the fields is an
object, then you use that object's equals,

154
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:40,849
which reapplies the world the rule
recursively. And then if you ever feel

155
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:46,851
that it's an array you can go ahead and
try applying it to each entry. And there's

156
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:53,664
implementations in Java. You don't want to
use A, A. = B. That checks if those arrays

157
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:59,006
are the same objects. And that's not what
you want you want to check that all the

158
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:04,027
values are the same. And if it's array of
objects you can see that testing for

159
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:10,037
equals can actually involve a lot a code
and a lot a cost. Alright so and certainly

160
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:15,597
you want to follow some of these best
practices. So fields that are most likely

161
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:21,427
to differ. Those are the ones you might
want to compare first. And your also going

162
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:27,100
to want to make compare to consistent with
equals. The rule generally if we're have a

163
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,693
comparable types we'll use to compare to.
If we don't have a comparable types then

164
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:40,103
we'll use equals. Okay, so now let's look
at a couple of test clients before we look

165
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:48,934
at any particular implementation. So this
is a test client so symbol tables are ST

166
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:57,122
is the type, symbol table, they're generic
on key and value. And so this, this

167
00:16:57,122 --> 00:17:05,171
statement builds a new symbol table with
string keys and integer values that's

168
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:11,571
going to associate integers with strings.
And so what the test client is going do is

169
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:17,527
going to a just go in a loop as long as
standard n is not empty, and it's going to

170
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:23,380
read strings, read a string off standard
input, and then put it in the symbol table

171
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,470
associated with the value I where did it
appear in the value input. So this is an

172
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:36,234
index same client where we associate each
string with its position most recent

173
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:43,052
position in the input. And, notice it's an
associative array implementation so for

174
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:49,261
example, we have two Es and at the end E
is a associated value twelve. The place

175
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:56,191
where it most recently appeared. We could
also keep these things in a bag and do a

176
00:17:56,191 --> 00:18:03,596
client that does all the positions that
appeared. This is a simple indexing client

177
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:11,622
that we use for our traces. [cough] For
analysis for bigger problems we'll use a

178
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:17,236
client called the frequency counter
client. And so that one is going to read a

179
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:23,303
sequence of strings from standard input
and print out the one that occurs with

180
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:30,863
highest frequency. So, so for this small
data from the beginning of Dickens' Tale

181
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:37,727
of two Cities if we run a frequency
count-, or the frequency counter client.

182
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:44,411
And this first argument is just ignore
words of fewer than this many letters.

183
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:51,221
It'll say that the most frequent word
where there's no word that appears more

184
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:57,771
frequently than it which appears ten
times. And we'll want this client to work

185
00:18:57,771 --> 00:19:04,547
well for huge data sets so Liepzeig is a,
a data set from the web of about twenty

186
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:11,293
million words. About half a million
distinct ones and in that Corpus, the word

187
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:20,250
government appears about 25,000 times. So,
if you have a quadratic time algorithm for

188
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,025
implementing simple tables or linear time
for each operation. You're not going to be

189
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:31,330
able to run this client in a reasonable
amount of time for a big amount of data.

190
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,449
So that's the client that we're going to
use for analysis. Here's the code for that

191
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:42,555
frequency counter client. Again, it's
similar to the other one, we're creating a

192
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:47,773
simple table that associates strings with
integers. We take that command line

193
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:53,451
argument which is the minimum length that
we care about. We will read a new word.

194
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:59,015
We'll ignore the short strings. Just trap
out if the word length is too small. And

195
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:04,783
now the integer we are going to associate
with each word is the frequency of

196
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:10,507
occurrence of that word in a symbol table.
So if word is not in the symbol table,

197
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:16,072
we'll put it there with a frequency of
occurrence of one. That's the first time

198
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:21,469
we saw the word. If it is in the symbol
table, we will just over write. The old

199
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:27,146
value, which is ST get word, with the new
value, ST ge t word plus one. So increment

200
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:32,532
the frequency in the symbol table. So
that's, read, this loop reads in all the

201
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:38,118
data and associates each word with its
frequency of occurrence. And then we'll

202
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:44,055
have a client that uses the iterator,
going through all the keys in the symbol

203
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:50,271
table. It'll get the value associated with
each key. And if that's bigger than the

204
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:55,859
maximum found so far, we'll save that
away. And then print out the, the word

205
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:02,675
that occurs the, the most often along with
its frequency. So this is a useful and non

206
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:08,744
trivial client that's enable by symbol
table. And, but it won't work well unless

207
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:14,140
we have an efficient symbol table
operation. And we'll use this client to

208
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:19,433
compare different symbol table
implementations. So that's the symbol

209
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:23,046
table API. And next, we'll take a look at
implementations.
