1
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:08,015
All right so QuickFind is too slow for
huge problems. So, how are we going to do

2
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:14,035
better? Our first attempt is an
alternative called, Quick-union. This is

3
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:20,082
so called lazy approach to algorithm
design where we try to avoid doing work

4
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:27,506
until we have to. It uses the same data
structure or array ID with size M but now

5
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:34,280
it has a different interpretation. We are
going to think of that array as

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,298
representing a set of trees that's called
a forest as depicted at right. So, each

7
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:49,468
entry in the array is going to contain a
reference to its parent in the tree. So,

8
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:57,425
for example, 3's parent is four, 4's
parent is nine. So 3's entry is four and

9
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:06,681
4's entry is nine in the array. Now each
entry in the array has associated with it

10
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:13,179
a root. That's the root of its tree.
Elements that are all by themselves in

11
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:19,303
just, in their own connected component,
point to themselves, so one points to

12
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:26,108
itself but also nine points to itself.
It's the root of the tree, containing two,

13
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:32,419
four and three. So, from this data
structure we can associate with each item

14
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:40,202
a root, which is representative, say, of
it's connected component. So that's the

15
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:47,044
root of three is nine, going up that root.
Now, once we can calculate these roots,

16
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:52,956
then we can implement the find operation
just by checking whether the two items

17
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:57,592
that we're supposed to check with are
connective where they have the same root.

18
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:02,373
That's equivalent to saying, are they in
the same connective component? So that's

19
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:09,240
some work, going to find the roots of each
item but the union operation is very easy.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,254
To merge components containing two
different items. Two items that are in

21
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:21,613
different components. All we do is set the
ID of P's route to the ID of Q's route.

22
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:28,748
Let's make P's tree point to Q. So in this
case, we would change the entry of nine to

23
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:35,027
be six to merge three and five. The
components containing three and five. And

24
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:41,317
with just changing one value in the array
we get the two large components emerged

25
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:46,295
together. That's the Quick-union
algorithm. Because a union operation only

26
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:52,429
involves changing one entry in the array.
Find operation requires a little more

27
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:57,907
work. So let's look at the Implementation,
a demo of that one in operation first. So

28
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:03,569
again we, we start out the same way but
now the idea array entry really means that

29
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,415
every one of these things is a little tree
where the one node each everyone pointing

30
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:15,284
to itself. It's the root of it's own tree
so now if we have to put four and three in

31
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:21,236
the same component, then all we do is we
take the root, of the component containing

32
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:26,624
the first item and make that a child of
the root of the component, component

33
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:33,029
containing the second item. In this case
we just make four as parent three. So now

34
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:39,823
three and eight. So again, we take the
first item and make it a child of the root

35
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:47,532
of the tree containing the second item. So
now three, four, and eight are in the same

36
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:56,434
component. Six and five six goes below
five. Nine and four, So now four is the

37
00:03:56,434 --> 00:04:06,045
root of the tree containing four is eight.
And the root of tree containing nine is

38
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:13,745
nine. And so we make nine a child of
eight. Two and one, that's an easy one.

39
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:20,993
Now if we get our, our eight and nine
connected, we just checked that they have

40
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:28,011
the same root and they both have the same
root eight and so they're connected. Five

41
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:34,230
and four 4's root is eight. 5's root is
five. They're different. They're not

42
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:42,339
connected. Five and zero. Five goes to be
a child of zero. Seven and two seven goes

43
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:52,836
to be a child of 2's root which is one.
Six and one. 6's route is zero 1's its own

44
00:04:52,836 --> 00:05:00,636
route, so zero becomes a child of one.
Each one of these union operations just

45
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:10,069
involves changing one entry in the array.
And finally, seven and three. So seven's

46
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:18,755
root is one, three's root is eight, one
becomes a child of eight. Okay and now we

47
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:26,012
have one connected component with all the
items together. Alright, so now let's look

48
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:32,668
at the code for implementing Quick-union.
The constructor is the same as the other

49
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:40,967
one. We create the array and then set each
element to be it's own root. Now we have a

50
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:46,005
private method that implements this
process of finding the root by chasing

51
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:51,352
parent pointers until we get to the point
where I is equal to ID of I, and if it's

52
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:57,369
not equal, we just move I up one level in
the tree, set I equals ID of I and return

53
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:02,005
it. So starting at any node, you just
follow ID equals ID of I until they're

54
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:07,396
equal and then you're at a root and that's
a private method that we can use to

55
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:11,959
implement the find operation or the
connected operation. You just find the

56
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,316
root of P and the root of Q and if you
check if they're equal. And then the union

57
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:23,342
operation is simply find the two roots I
and then set the idea the first one could

58
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:30,310
be the second one. Actually less code than
for Quick Find, no fore loops. There's

59
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:37,139
this one wild loop that we have to worry
about a little bit. But that's a quick and

60
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,326
elegant implementation of code to solve
the dynamic connectivity problem called

61
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:50,318
Quick-union. So now we're going to have to
look at can this code be effective for

62
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:57,657
large problems? Well unfortunately
Quick-union is faster but it's also too

63
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:04,042
slow. And it's a little different kind of
too slow then for Quick Find, there's

64
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:10,005
times when it could be fast, but there's
also times when it could be too slow. And

65
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:16,256
the defect for Quick-union is that the
trees can get too tall. Which would mean

66
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:22,065
that the find operation would be too
expensive. You could wind up with a long

67
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:28,432
skinny tree. Of each object just pointing
to next and then to do a find operation

68
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:33,976
for object at the bottom would involve
going all the way through the tree.

69
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:40,184
Costing involving in the ray axises just
to do the find operation and that's going

70
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:44,013
to be too slow if you have a lot of
operations.
