00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:07,328
Welcome back. Next we're going to talk
about Binary Search Trees, a classic data

2
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:12,439
structures that'll enables us to provide
efficient implementation of symbol table

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,860
and out rhythms. [cough] Let's look at the
basic Binary Search Tree data structure

4
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:23,979
with Heaps we talk about implicit
representation of trees with an array. For

5
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:28,493
Binary Search Trees we're going to talk
about actually explicit tree data

6
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:35,015
structures. A binary search tree is a
binary tree in symmetric order. Let's look

7
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:40,096
at the meaning of those words. So, a
binary tree is an explicit data structure.

8
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:47,233
It's got what we call nodes which contain
information and every node's got two links

9
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:53,841
to Binary Trees that are disjoint from one
another, a left tree and right tree

10
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:59,969
associated with each node. Each node has a
left tree and a right tree. Links can be

11
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,150
null. Left tree can be null and right tree
can be null or both. We refer to every

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,072
node in the tree as the root of a sub-tree
and [cough] referred to, the nodes below.

13
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:20,142
Each node is its children so this is the
right child of the root. And that's a left

14
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:25,986
link, and so forth. So that's the
definition of a binary tree. A binary

15
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:32,220
search tree, each node has a key and every
nodes key is larger than all the keys in

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,110
its left subtree and smaller than all the
keys in its right subtree. This is a

17
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,945
different ordering than we have to heap if
we have a node larger than both its

18
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:49,435
children, this one, every node is between
the values, the value of every node is

19
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:54,879
between the values of the nodes in its two
subtrees. So the nodes to the left of e

20
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,702
are smaller and nodes to the right of e
are larger. [cough] now we're going to use

21
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:05,118
these to implement symbol tables and
there's values associated with each key

22
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,907
when appropriate, we'll write the values
in smaller numbers next to the keys. But

23
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:14,701
usually, we're just going to worry about
the keys and we'll keep the values, in the

24
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:19,403
nodes along with them [cough] so that's
binary search trees. A binary tree in

25
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:24,618
symmetric order that's the data structur e
that we're going to use to implement

26
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:30,527
symbol table operations. So how are we're
going to represent binary search trees in

27
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:35,648
Java? Well, we're going to extend our
implementations of linked list structures

28
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,896
to have two references instead of just
one. So first of all, is the, there's a

29
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:46,551
node at the root. So, a binary search tree
in Java is just going to be referenced to

30
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:51,607
a root node. And every node's got four
fields, a key and a value, and references

31
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:56,634
to the left subtree, that contains the
smaller keys, and the right subtree that

32
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:03,251
contains the larger keys. So, here's what
the, [cough] code is based on. The, inner

33
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:10,577
class that we used to implement nodes has,
one, two, three, four instance variables.

34
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:16,889
All of which are private as usual. A key
of type key, a value of type value and

35
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:23,017
then references to a left and a right
node. For convenience, we'll provide a

36
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:28,525
constructor that takes the key and value
as argument and fills in the key and value

37
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:35,055
instance variables then the left and right
links are initialized to null. And our

38
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:41,016
data structure then will be a root that
points to a node in the tree and then that

39
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:46,085
node will point to subtrees and that will
be the data structure that we use for

40
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:53,363
symbol tables. So here's the skeleton of
our symbol table implementation. It's for

41
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:59,887
comparable keys associated with values and
those are both generic types. The only

42
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:07,093
instance variable is a link to the root
node called root. The inner class node is

43
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:12,997
the code that was given on the previous
slide, and then we'll need implementations

44
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:18,678
of put and get, and we'll also look at an
implementation of delete, and an iterator

45
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:23,801
as well. So that's our skeleton
implementation, let's look at the keys. So

46
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:30,238
let's look at search first. So here's a
binary search tree let's do a demo of what

47
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:37,963
different searches will look like in this
tree. So there's a tree so S is at the

48
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:45,299
root everybody to the left of is less than
S over to the right is bigger. So this is

49
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:51,072
a dynamic data structure that kind of
follows the same rule as binary search. So

50
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:56,419
to look for a, to do a search for the key
H in this tree, we start at the root and

51
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:02,315
we compare our key against the key at the
root. And in this case, H is less so all

52
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:08,152
that says to us is that if H is in the
tree, it has to be to the left cuz

53
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:13,671
everybody to the right is greater than S.
So we move to the left and compare H

54
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:19,028
against the root of the left subtree. In
this case that's E. Now H is greater so

55
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:25,497
that says we should go right. Now we can
pair H against the root of the right

56
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:32,414
subtree of E, and that's R and it's less
so we have to go left cuz everybody to the

57
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:38,957
right of R is bigger and H is smaller. And
eventually if the key is in the tree,

58
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:45,625
we're going to hit it. In this case we, we
find H as the left sub tree of R in

59
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:52,529
[cough] that's a search hit and then for
the get operation, we can return the value

60
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:58,615
that's stored in that node along with the
key H. What about an unsuccessful search?

61
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:04,826
Well the same rules follow. If it's in the
tree, it's gotta be according to the left

62
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:09,606
or right, according to whether it's
smaller or larger than the key at the

63
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:14,354
route. In this case, if we're searching
for G, it's gotta go left, because it's

64
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:19,471
less than S. When we come against the E,
we gotta go right because it's bigger than

65
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:24,452
E against the R, we have to go left,
because it's less than R. We come against

66
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:30,141
the H, we have to go left. And then we
come off a null link, and all that says is

67
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:36,903
that there's no place in this tree where G
could be so G is not there. So that's a

68
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:43,684
search miss. And the get operation would
return null in that case. What about

69
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:49,788
insertion? Well, to insert a new key, all
we do is follow the same steps as we did

70
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:56,003
for search. That following off that null
link and again, we'll just, for G, travel

71
00:06:56,003 --> 00:07:01,654
down the tree until we come to the, null
link. Really, what we're saying is when we

72
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:07,747
go to the left link of H, it says, if G is
in the tree, it has to be down this link.

73
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:14,536
Since it's not there to in sert G, all we
need to do is just put it there and that's

74
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:20,277
how we insert a new node into a binary
search tree. Alright, here's the code

75
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:26,740
corresponding to the process that we just
demo. And it's quite straight forward

76
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:33,068
simple code as simple as binary search
really. We start at the root then we set

77
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:39,528
variable x to be the root and that's going
to be the pointer to the current node as

78
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:46,353
we move down the tree. As long as our, our
current node x is not null what we'll want

79
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:52,064
to do is a comparison between the key at
node x and our search key. If our search

80
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:57,239
key is less, we go to the left. If it's
greater we go to the right. And if it's

81
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:02,381
equal we don't even have to test that,
that's why it's in grey. If it's not

82
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:08,013
greater or lesser it has to be equal, than
we return the value right at that node. If

83
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:13,903
we get to the bottom and our current node
is null and that's falling off the bottom

84
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:19,982
of the tree we return null and that's
equivalent to saying our buyer convention

85
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:25,305
that, that key is not in our data
structure, or not in our symbol table. So

86
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:31,111
that's very straightforward implementation
of the get operation for symbol tables

87
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:37,711
with a binary search tree representation.
Now, what's the cost? Well, we went down a

88
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:43,718
path in the tree so it's one plus the
depth of the node in the tree. [cough] So

89
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:50,107
what about search well search for put
there's two cases. If the if we're

90
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:56,023
supposed to associate a value with a key.
If the key's already in the tree then

91
00:08:56,246 --> 00:09:02,237
we're just going to reset the value. If
they key's not in the tree then we add a

92
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:07,830
new node at the bottom. So now it's a
little bit tricky the way that we

93
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:14,217
implement it since we're using we use a
recursive implementation. And the reason

94
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:19,705
we do this is that it generalizes to give
us more efficient data structures later

95
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:26,000
on. So, what we'll do is use a recursive
implementation that as it moves down the

96
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,885
tree it'll return a link up higher in the
tree. And so when we insert a new node L

97
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:38,064
say in this tree we go down that path, we
create a new node and then return the link

98
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:43,172
to that node higher up. There's ways to
implement that don't involve this, but

99
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:49,495
its, the code is so simple and it extends
to more powerful data structures later on

100
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:55,574
that we'll introduce this right now and,
and you'll see how it works. So here's

101
00:09:55,574 --> 00:10:01,159
the, this is very concise recursive code
but its tricky because of that last point

102
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:09,049
so its worth reading carefully. So, we're
going to use a recursive method put. That

103
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:18,476
put a associate a value with a key in the
tree. And that recursive [cough] method is

104
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:25,280
going to return a node. So the client
method put of course, just is supposed to

105
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,315
do the association so it has a void
return. But what we'll do is invoke a

106
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:35,858
recursive method starting at the root and
whatever link gets returned, we'll set

107
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:42,000
that to root. So right away, we can see,
let's suppose that we have an empty tree

108
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,212
where root is null. So then if we put with
null as the first argument, then null is

109
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:55,211
the first argument. What we do is we say
if, if the argument is null, return a

110
00:10:55,211 --> 00:11:01,552
reference to a new node that associates
key with value and then that one has null

111
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:07,090
links. So in this case, that first call
will return a link and whatever link gets

112
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,095
returned, that will be set to root. So,
without any extra special code we insert a

113
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:19,766
node into an empty tree. And that works,
again, recursively say we have one node in

114
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:26,861
the tree, and we have a new key to
associate. And let's say that key is less

115
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:33,348
than the key at the root. So, so now we do
put in it's actually a link to that one

116
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:39,852
node that's got two null links. So it's
not null so we'll compare our key against

117
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:45,584
the key in that node. If that comparison
comes out left, here's how we do the

118
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:51,870
insert. We change our left link which is
right now it's null to whatever put

119
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,692
returns. So what's put going to return?
Well, that left link is null, so what's

120
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:03,342
going to happen is, in that call x is
null. It's going to be cre ated a new node

121
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:08,272
and the link to that node will be returned
and that's the link that we'll put in the

122
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:13,020
left. This is a very concise code that
otherwise we'd have various cases about

123
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,909
saving which link we went down in order to
reset that later on. So now the best way

124
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:25,957
having looked at those small examples, the
best way to understand this code is

125
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:32,076
recursively. Let's believe that it works
for small cases which we have just done.

126
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:37,262
So, lets see what the code does. So if x
is null, we want to create a new node and

127
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:41,617
return the link to that node. So, even if
it's a huge tree down at the bottom, we

128
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:46,107
just came of a null link. We just want to
create a new node with our new key and

129
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:51,707
return a link to that node, that's all we
want to do. Now, we can assume that put is

130
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:59,100
going to return a link to a sub-tree that
contains our new key and if our new key is

131
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,977
smaller than the key at the node that,
that we're processing now, then [cough] we

132
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:10,419
want to insert the new key value there and
the new node on the left otherwise, we

133
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:16,428
want to insert on the right. Most of the
time, the link that we get back will be

134
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:23,299
same as the link that we put in but for
the bottom node it will be different. So,

135
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:29,277
if put works properly inserting a new node
on the left, then that's what we want our

136
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:35,310
left link to be. If it works properly,
putting in the subtree on the right,

137
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,537
that's what we want our right link to be.
And by the way, if we find a key that's in

138
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:47,267
the tree already, then we just want to
reset the value. And in all of these cases

139
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:53,929
where we're on a node that already
existed, we just want to return the link

140
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:59,380
to that node. Again, when we look at more
sophisticated values we'll be returning

141
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,398
something else. So it's worthwhile you
know, checking that you believe that this

142
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:10,178
code implements the simple binary search
tree algorithm that we demoed where when

143
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:15,474
we fall off a null link we created a new
node and replaced that null link with the

144
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:21,102
new node . So that's insert for a binary
search tree in a symbol table. And again,

145
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:26,258
the cost of this is the number of compares
is equal to one plus the depth of the

146
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:31,441
node. We just go down a path in the tree.
Now, what's interesting about binary

147
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:36,819
search trees is that there are many
different binary search trees that

148
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:42,926
correspond to the same set of keys. So the
number it compares is going to depend on

149
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:47,787
the order in which the keys come in. And
that's a key feature of binary search

150
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:53,458
trees that we'll come back to again when
we look at more sophisticated data

151
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:59,159
structures. So it depends on how the keys
come in. The shape of the, of the tree

152
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,539
could be well in the best case so it would
be perfectly balanced. And one of the

153
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:09,875
things we'll look at is algorithms that
come very, very close to achieving that

154
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:15,069
goal. The typical, typical case it'll be
sort of balanced. Now but one problem is

155
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:20,099
if the keys come in and, and really
unfortunately, if they come in, in a

156
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:26,019
natural order. Like if they come in, in
order, that's the worst case. We don't get

157
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:31,052
any benefit from having it in a tree
shape. It's no different than a link list.

158
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:37,171
So we'll, we'll come back to dealing with
that worse case in the next lecture. But

159
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:41,636
the point is, the tree shape depends on
the order of insertion. Now, but let's

160
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:47,562
look at what's happened or visualize what
happens when keys come in, in random

161
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:54,930
order. So the tree grows from the bottom
in the little side to side motion it's

162
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,250
just accommodating room for each new key
as it's added. But you could see that even

163
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:09,379
for this case which is hundreds of keys,
the length of the path from top to bottom

164
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:16,280
is not so much. In this case, the maximum
distance from the top to the bottom is

165
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,061
sixteen the average is only nine and the
best you could in a perfectly balanced

166
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:30,017
tree it would be seven. So it's pretty
well balanced which means that our search

167
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:37,114
and insert cost in this case for 255 keys
is only going to be sixteen quite a bit

168
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:45,449
less. So one remark before we do the
analysis is that actually binary search

169
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:53,343
trees correspond exactly to Quicksort
partitioning. In the binary search tree,

170
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,750
we have a node at the root and we have
everybody smaller to the left, and

171
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,251
everybody larger to the right. In
Quicksort partitioning, after the random

172
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:10,800
shuffling we have the partitioning element
and then we process everybody to the left

173
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,595
independently of everybody to the right.
So it's a [cough] there's a direct

174
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:21,732
correspondence. If there is no duplicate
keys Quicksort processes them and referred

175
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:26,185
them out in BSTs and if there's no
duplicate keys there's a one-to-one

176
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:31,291
correspondence between what happens with
Quicksort and what happens with binary

177
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:36,551
search trees. And we point that out
because that helps with the mathematical

178
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:42,083
analysis. In fact, this correspondence
with Quicksort partitioning tells us we

179
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:49,044
can take that proof and prove that if you
insert in distinct keys into a BST, in

180
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:55,073
random order, then the expected number of
compares for a search and an insert is two

181
00:17:55,073 --> 00:18:04,164
natural log N. So again about 1.38 log
base two of N almost the best that you

182
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:10,660
could do. It also has been shown actually
not that long ago, that the expected

183
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,891
height of the tree if they're inserted in
random order, the height that's the worst

184
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,741
case length of a path in the tree. This is
the average path in a tree, this is the,

185
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:28,622
the worst of all the keys. This is about
four natural log N. So, if you have the

186
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:34,738
keys in random order the binary search
tree gives efficient search and insert.

187
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:41,768
Now but there is this problem that the
actual worst case height if the keys come

188
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:48,223
in, in order and reverse order and other
natural orders that the time could be

189
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:53,808
proportional to n. So, we have this
summary which is looking pretty good,

190
00:18:54,014 --> 00:19:00,559
because we have the average case for both
operations, the search and insert, to be

191
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,050
1.39 log N and that's probabilistic if
they are in random order, its extremely

192
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,124
likely to be there. But the problem by
comparison with sorting is, we don't get

193
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:17,044
to randomize the order the client is
providing the keys. So we're going to need

194
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:22,161
something better to provide the guarantee
than just randomly ordering the keys.

195
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:26,935
That's what we're going to be looking at
next when we look at more efficient

196
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:31,942
algorithms. But first we're going to look
at the implementation of order and

197
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:36,972
operations with the binary search tree
structure. It expands like binary search

198
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:41,863
to handle all these convenient client
operations in a very natural manner.

199
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:46,879
That's the implementation of binary search
trees for symbol tables. They give

200
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:57,069
sufficient implementation of both search
and insert.
