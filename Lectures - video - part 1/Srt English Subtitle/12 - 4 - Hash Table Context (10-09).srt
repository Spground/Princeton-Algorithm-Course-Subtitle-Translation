1
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:07,072
So let's just look at a little bit of the
context of hashing in practical

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:12,067
applications. As I mentioned, it's very
widely used. So here's an, here's an

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:17,077
example right from Java. The first.
Implementation of Java 1.1. The designers

4
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:22,090
found that the cost of computing the hash
function for strings seemed to be

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,011
excessive, particularly for long strings.
And that was one of the main uses of

6
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:32,306
hashing, was just to be able to do
searching with string keys. And so what

7
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:37,883
they decided in the first implementation
was let's just look at every eighth or

8
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:43,020
ninth character, and that way, we don't
have to spend a lot of time computing the

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,859
hash function. So they had a hash function
pretty much like the one that we use.

10
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:54,173
Except that it compute a skip that would
mean that, that only look at about every

11
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:59,232
eight key and they wouldn't have to do
quite so much work performing the hash

12
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:05,414
function. And that's diffidently one thing
to consider when using hashing is that the

13
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:11,000
cost of computing the hash function for a
complicated key might exceed the cost of

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,026
searching and using a simpler structure
like a binary search tree. And anyway for

15
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:23,039
Java 1.1 what happened was that there was
a huge potentail for really bad collision

16
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:28,594
patterns on typical data. So here's the
example of typical data, which is a URL.

17
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:33,581
All of these keys, which are totally
different, would wind up having the same

18
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:39,319
collision. And so client programs and
system programs on the Java system were

19
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,059
having terrible performance on their
symbol table because of the shortcut in

20
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:50,749
hashing. So this well illustrates that you
need to use all of the data in the hash

21
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:56,692
function and sometime we do a closer
analysis. The cost of computing the hash

22
00:01:56,692 --> 00:02:02,845
function can mean that something like red
black trees will even outperform hashing

23
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:08,982
even for just searching and insert. So
there is another thing about the uniform

24
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:15,310
hashing assumption is that it is an
assumption and if you are writing code

25
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,015
where we have to have guaranteed
performance like when your aircraft is

26
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:29,593
landing or you are controlling a nuclear
reactor or somebody's pa cemaker. That, if

27
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:35,374
that assumption doesn't hold and you get
bad performance you're going to have

28
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:41,131
disastrous consequences. So that's another
reason to think about maybe paying a

29
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:46,084
little extra and using to guarantee that
you get with red black search trees.

30
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:52,059
Instead of hashing. And there's another
surprising situation that happens in

31
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:59,620
today's world. For example Java publishes
its hash function. And so if you're trying

32
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,423
to provide a service over the web. An
adversary can learn your hash function and

33
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:13,074
just send you data that causes huge
performance problem by just making all

34
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:21,002
that data hash to one particular item. And
that's definitely something to worry

35
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:27,081
about. And, and in the real world you can
nowadays find on the web particular

36
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:34,037
sequences of keys that will cause
particular services to crash. And again,

37
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:39,093
that's a little harder to do with
something like a red black tree where we

38
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:44,095
have performance guarantees. When you make
an assumption you better be sure and

39
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:50,034
you're depending on that assumption, you
better be sure that it holds somehow. This

40
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:55,029
is different than for example for quick
sort when we, our assumption was we're

41
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,073
going to create randomness and we are
going to depend on that randomness. In

42
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:04,042
this care we're kind of hoping for
randomness and maybe that doesn't really

43
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:09,081
always hold. So that's certainly something
to be aware of when using hashing in

44
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:15,445
practice. So here's just simple example on
hashing in java. So what we can do is it's

45
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:21,509
pretty easy to find a family of strings
that have the same hash code for example

46
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,668
with just a little fooling around now days
you can just look it up on the web, you

47
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:32,439
can see that these two character keys,
both have the same hash code because when

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,369
you just do the math in a base 31 hash
code it'll tell you that answer. Well what

49
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:43,755
that means is that actually, just like
working in binary you got, you can combine

50
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:50,438
those things. In all possible ways, and
you can get two to the N strings, for any

51
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:57,526
N of length to N that all hash to the same
value. And somebody's implemented a

52
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:05,380
service in Java that it uses a simp le
table that takes string keys, you can

53
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:12,212
cause that to crash in this way. Little
bit scary for some systems designers. At

54
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:19,163
least reason for pause in using hashing.
Now, hashing also has a extremely

55
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:28,292
important application in today's Internet
commerce. And so the, it's the concept of

56
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:37,164
so called one way hash functions which
mean that we, we, use it for secure to try

57
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:45,889
to be, have some secure fingerprints for
use on the web. And there's been a lot

58
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:52,772
research done to develop functions that
take keys as input, and then produce

59
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:58,638
values that look random. In such a way
that, it's hard for someone else to find

60
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:04,241
another key that collides with that. This
technology is, is useful for storing

61
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:09,703
passwords and digital fingerprints and
things. But it's too expensive for use, in

62
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:15,584
a symbol table. So the bottom line is
separate chaining versus linear probin

63
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:21,995
collision resolution message methods. Now
there's a number of considerations to take

64
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:28,974
into account. Separate chaining is really
easy to implement both insert and delete

65
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:35,098
it performs, it degrades, it does so
gracefully and the clustering is, is maybe

66
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:42,050
less of a problem if you have a bad hash
function. Linear probing tends to make

67
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,747
better use of space. And also it'll
perform better for huge tables whereas

68
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:52,885
caching is involved. And if, in the
classic algorithm or computer science

69
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:58,695
problems for people to think about is what
do we do to delete in these two situations

70
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:03,496
and exactly how do we resize. Those are
all at the level of exercises in the

71
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:09,138
context of the kinds of algorithms that
we've seen. And as I mentioned, there's

72
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:14,227
been many, many improved versions of
hashing that have been studied. I

73
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:19,598
mentioned the two probe, or double hashing
version. Another way to use two hash

74
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,600
functions is just to hash the two
positions and put the key in the shorter

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,802
of the two chains. In, in that case, then
the expected length of the longest chain

76
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:34,635
will be lg, lg N which is quite an
improvement. You get constant time

77
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:40,078
expected and lg, lg N worst case. Double
hashing is the variant of layer probing

78
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:45,930
where you just skip a variable amount, not
one each time. And that pretty much wipes

79
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,106
out clustering but it, it is more
difficult to implement delete for that

80
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:56,280
one. In a new method called, relatively
new method called Cuckoo Hashing. It's

81
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,061
another variant of linear probing where we
hash a key to two positions and insert the

82
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:06,807
key in either one. If occupied you, you
reinsert the displaced key into its

83
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:11,753
alternative. It was in one, each one can
go to two. And that one actually gives

84
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:17,154
constant worst case time for search.
That's another variation on the team. And

85
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:22,296
all of these things allow us to make
better use of memory, allows the table to

86
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:27,434
become nearly full. It would have been
very exciting. Thing to be researchers in

87
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:32,684
the 1950's who cared so much about memory
and nowadays a little extra memory is not

88
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:37,391
something that people care about so much
and most people just go with the easy

89
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:42,814
algorithm except for really performance
critical applications. What about hash

90
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:48,640
tables versus balance search trees? Well
hash tables are really simple to code

91
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,576
usually if you don't have to do the hash
function. And if you don't have order in

92
00:08:54,576 --> 00:09:00,108
the keys at all then you need the compare
to, to implement balance search trees. So

93
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:05,751
you have to use hashing if you don't have
the comparison. And it'll probably be

94
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:11,798
faster for simple keys to use hashing.
It's a few arithmetic operations to do the

95
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:16,852
hash versus lg N and compares for the
balance tree. And there's some better

96
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:22,020
system support in Java for strings that
cache hash code means that you don't even

97
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,010
have to compute the hash if your, your
simple table for strings is in an inner

98
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,179
loop. On the other hand, balanced search
trees have a much stronger performance

99
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,376
guarantee. It, you don't have to assume
anything. It's going to be less than lg N

100
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:42,877
and compares and it's got support for all
those ordered ST operations, and compared

101
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:48,175
to and is pretty easy and natural function
to implement. So it's more flexible and

102
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:54,660
more broadly useful. And actually the Java
system and other systems include both so

103
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,902
that programmers can make use of either
one in diff erent situations. That's our

104
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,082
context for hashing algorithms.
