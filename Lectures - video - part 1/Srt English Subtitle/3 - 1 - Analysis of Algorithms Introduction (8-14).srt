00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,036
Welcome back. Today we're going to do some
math and some science. Not a lot, but we

2
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:11,055
need to have a scientific basis for
understanding the performance of our

3
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:15,075
algorithms to properly deploy them in
practise. So today we're going to talk,

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:20,040
about how to, observe performance
characteristics of algorithms. We're going

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,022
to look at how to make mathematical models
and how to classify algorithms according

6
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:30,010
to the order of growth of their running
time. We'll talk a bit about the theory of

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,790
algorithms and also how to analyze memory
usage. So to put this all in perspective,

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,206
we're going to think about these issues
from the point of view of different types

9
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:48,139
of characters. So the first one is the
programmer who needs to solve a problem

10
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:54,270
and get it working and get it deployed.
Second one is the client who wants to use

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,167
the whatever program did to get the job
done. Third one is the theoretician,

12
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:06,424
that's somebody who really wants to
understand what's going on. And, and the

13
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:10,724
last one is kind of a team, this basic
blocking and tackling sometimes necessary

14
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:15,790
to get, you know, all these things done.
So, there's a little bit of each one of

15
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,110
these in today's lecture. And actually
when you're a student you have to think

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,753
that you might be playing any or all of
these roles some day. So, it's pretty

17
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:31,522
important to understand the different
points of view. So, the key that we'll

18
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:38,205
focus on is running time. And actually the
idea of understanding the running time of

19
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:44,017
a computation goes way back even to
Babbage and probably before. And here's a

20
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:48,083
quote from Babbage, "As soon as an
analytical engine exists, it will

21
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:54,076
necessarily guide the future course of the
science. Whenever any result is sought by

22
00:01:54,076 --> 00:02:00,062
its aid, the question will arise by what
course of calculation can these results be

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:06,072
arrived at by the machine in the shortest
time". If you look at Babbage's machine

24
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:12,009
called the analytic engine, it's got a
crank on it. And literally the concern

25
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,060
that Babbage had in knowing how long a
computation would take is, how m any times

26
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,048
do we have to turn the crank. It's, it's
not that different, in today's world. The

27
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:29,018
crank may be something electronic that's
happening a billion times a second. But

28
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:34,041
still, we're looking for, how many times
does some discreet operation have to be

29
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:39,093
performed in order to get a computation
done. So, there are lot of reasons to

30
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:45,032
analyse algorithms. In the context of this
course we are mainly interested in

31
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:50,051
performance prediction. And we also want
to compare the performance of different

32
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:54,768
algorithms for the same task, and to be
able to provide some guarantees on how

33
00:02:54,768 --> 00:03:00,058
well they perform. Along with this, is
understanding some theoretical basis for

34
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:05,780
how algorithms perform. But primarily, the
practical reason that we want to be

35
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:11,098
analyzing algorithms and understanding
them is to avoid performance bugs. We want

36
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,050
to have some confidence that our
algorithms going to complete the job in

37
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,084
the amount of time, that, that we think it
will. And it's very, very frequent to see,

38
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:26,080
in today's computational infrastructure, a
situation where the client gets bad

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,026
performance, because the programmer did
not understand the performance

40
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:36,086
characteristics of the algorithm. And
today's lecture is about trying to avoid

41
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:42,087
that. Now, we're going to focus on
performance and comparing algorithms in

42
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:48,064
this course. There's later courses in
typical computer science curricula that

43
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:53,093
have more information about the
theoretical basis of algorithms and I'll

44
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:59,090
mention a little bit about that later on.
But our focus is on being able to predict

45
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:07,007
performance and comparing algorithms. Now
there's a long list of success stories in

46
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,081
designing algorithm with better
performance in, in enabling the solution

47
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:19,025
of problems that would otherwise not be
solved. And I'll just give a couple of

48
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:25,346
examples. One of the first and most famous
is the so called FFT algorithm. That's an

49
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:32,057
algorithm for breaking down the wave form
of n samples of a signal into periodic

50
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:38,431
components. And that's at the basis for
dvds and jpegs and, and many other appl

51
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:44,296
ications. There's an easy way to do it
that takes time proportional to N^2. But

52
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:49,080
the FFT algorithm, takes only N log N
steps. And the difference between N log N

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,002
and N^2 is, is the difference between
being able to solve a large problem and

54
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:59,078
not being able to solve it. A lot of the
digital technology, digital media

55
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:04,822
technology that we have today is enabled
by that fast algorithm. Another example

56
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:11,232
was actually developed by Andrew Appel,
who's now the chair of computer science

57
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:16,582
here at Princeton. And it was developed
when he was an undergraduate for his

58
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:22,725
senior thesis. It's a fast algorithm for
the N body simulation problem. The easy

59
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:28,548
algorithm takes time proportional to N^2,
but Appel's algorithm was an N log N

60
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:33,452
algorithm that again, meant that
scientists can do N body simulation for

61
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:41,478
huge values of N. And that enables new
research. S0, o the challenge is that we

62
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,677
usually face is, will my program be able
to solve a large practical input? And, and

63
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:52,024
actually, the working programmer is
actually faced with that all the time.

64
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:58,001
Why, why is my program running so slowly?
Why does it run out of memory? And that's

65
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:05,000
faced programmers for a really long time
and the insight to address this. Deuter

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,030
Kanoof, in the 1970s, was that, we really
can use the scientific method to

67
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,062
understand the performance of algorithms
in operation. Maybe we're not unlocking

68
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:23,010
new secrets of the universe but, we can
use the, scientific method, and treat the

69
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,042
computer, as something to be studied in
that way and come to an understanding of

70
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:34,008
how our program are going to perform. And
let's take a look at that in more detail.

71
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:39,063
So this just a quick summary of what we
mean by the scientific method, which has,

72
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:44,086
been successful for a couple of centuries
now. So, what we're going to do is,

73
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:50,008
observe from some feature of the natural
world. In this case, it's going to be the

74
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:54,857
running time of our program on a computer.
Then we're going to develop hypothesis

75
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:59,079
some model that's consistent with the
observations, and we're going to hope

76
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:04,040
that, that hypothesis is good enough that
it'll allow us to predict something.

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,031
Usually predict a running time for larger
problem size, or on a different computer.

78
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:13,097
And then we'll verify the predictions by
making more observations, and validate

79
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:18,058
until we're comfortable that our model
hypothesis and observations all agree.

80
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:22,077
That's a way to get comfort that we
understand the performance of our

81
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:28,056
programs. Now, the within the scientific
method, there's some basic principles and

82
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:33,082
the, the first is that if you're going to
run experiments, you should expect that

83
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:39,021
somebody else should be able to run
experiments and get the same result. And

84
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:44,067
also the hypotheses have to have a
specific property that the experiment can

85
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:49,736
show the hypothesis to be wrong. So, it
has to be carefully crafted, and we'll be

86
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:55,433
sure to try to do that. So, and again the
future of the natural world that we're

87
00:07:55,433 --> 00:08:00,822
studying is some particular computer that
exists in the natural world. It changes

88
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:07,049
the algorithm from an abstraction to a,
some, some kind of actual physical thing

89
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:11,083
happening like electrons racing around
inside the computer.
