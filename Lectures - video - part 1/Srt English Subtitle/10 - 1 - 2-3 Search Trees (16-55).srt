1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,853
Welcome back, today we're going to talk
about balance search trees,

2
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:12,150
Which will lead us to an ultimate symbol
table implementation that can provide fast

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,130
performance for all the simulative options
we've looked at, guaranteed.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,038
So here's the review of where we were with
single tables.

5
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:27,019
We took a look at the last time at the
binary search tree,

6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:32,866
Which if things are well modeled by random
exertions, have a great performance.

7
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:39,002
They get search and insert on in time
proportion for log base two of N and they

8
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:44,055
support ordered operations.
But really our goal is to have these

9
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:48,386
operations be guaranteed to take time
proportional to log N,

10
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:54,114
Because we don't have control over the
order of operations and they may not be

11
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:57,606
random at all.
And in fact, in many real applications,

12
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:01,733
they're not very random.
So that's what were going to look at now

13
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:07,320
is try to find an implementation that can
guarantee to be fast for all the symbol

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,260
table operations.
.

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,172
That's our challenge.
So what we're going to talk about to do

16
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:19,744
it, is an algorithm, that actually pretty
old algorithm called 2-3 trees, and a

17
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:25,457
particular implementation that requires
very little code, called left leaning red

18
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:31,381
black BSTs and then we'll talk about a
generalization called B-trees. And these

19
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:36,460
methods are all widely used throughout our
computational infrastructure.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,187
To start, we'll talk about 2-3 search
trees, which is a model that underlies the

21
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:50,148
concise and efficient implementation that
we're going to look at.

22
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:56,131
So, the 2-3 tree is a way to generalize
BSTs to provide the flexibility that we

23
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,728
need to guarantee fast performance.
And the idea is very simple,

24
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:06,127
We allow one or two keys per node.
That is, we allow for the possibility of

25
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,994
something called a 3-node that can hold
two keys,

26
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:15,674
But then it has to have three children.
In a regular BST node, the 2-node, we have

27
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:20,190
one link for the keys that are less than
the key in the node, and one link for the

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,279
keys that are greater.
In a 3-node, we need three links, one for

29
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:29,867
less, one for between and one for greater.
Another property of these 2-3 trees is

30
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:35,029
that we are going to have perfect balance,
That is every path from the route to a

31
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,790
null link is going to have the same link
in the 2-3 tree.

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,121
So, as I mentioned, the symmetric order is
part of the definition of a 2-3 tree.

33
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:51,648
Every 3-node has three links and two keys.
The left link is for the keys that are,

34
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:56,850
points to a 2-3 tree with the keys that
are smaller than the smaller of the two

35
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,077
keys in the 3-node.
The middle link points to a 2-3 tree that

36
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:04,459
contains all the keys that are between the
two keys.

37
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,661
And the right link points to all, 2-3 tree
containing all the keys that are larger

38
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:12,913
than the larger of the two keys in the
3-node.

39
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:17,010
Okay, let's take a look at a demo of
searching in a 2-3 tree.

40
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,407
So say we have this 2-3 tree here and we
want to search for whether or not H is one

41
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,818
of the keys in the tree.
So we start at the root,

42
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,815
Compare the search key against the key or
keys in the node.

43
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:36,436
And follow the link corresponding to the
interval that we know must contain the

44
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:41,923
search key by definition of the tree and
then we recursively continue the search.

45
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:47,409
So, if we're looking for H, it's less than
M, so the only place it could be in this

46
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,051
2-3 tree is in the 2-3 tree on the left
link,

47
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:54,656
So we follow the left link.
Now, we compare H with E and J, and in

48
00:03:54,656 --> 00:04:00,359
this case it's between, so now we are
going to take the middle link, that's the

49
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:06,212
only place that H possibly could be.
In this case, that node, one node 2-3 tree

50
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:11,315
contains H, so that's a search hit.
Let's take another example for

51
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:15,217
unsuccessful search, a key that's not in
the tree.

52
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:19,270
As usual, we start at the root.
It's less, so we go left.

53
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,383
And it's less than both keys,
So, if it's in the tree, it would have to

54
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:26,982
be in the left link and it's between those
two keys.

55
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:31,540
So if it's in the tree, it would have to
be on the middle link.

56
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,922
And that link is null, so that's a search
miss.

57
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:40,951
So the search is a natural generalization
of the search in, binary search trees.

58
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:46,675
Now what about inserting?
Well, it's a similar type of strategy as

59
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:53,502
with regular binary search trees, except
that we manipulate the two and 3-node to

60
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:58,964
keep perfect balance in the tree.
So the easy case is if the key winds up in

61
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:04,930
a 2-node at the bottom, like this one.
Suppose we're inserting K. K is less than

62
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,762
M so we go left.
K is greater than both the keys, so we go

63
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:14,030
right.
K is less than L, so the search ends at

64
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,219
the left link of L.
And to perform an insertion all we need to

65
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,990
do is replace that 2-node with a 3-node
containing K.

66
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,676
Now, K is inserted into the 2-3 tree and
it satisfies all the rules.

67
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:34,553
Now if we're inserting into a 3-node at
the bottom, we have to do more work.

68
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:40,149
And specifically, the work we do is, we
add the key to a 3-node to create a

69
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:45,955
temporary 4-node and then split up that
four node and move it's middle key into

70
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,403
the parent.
So, let's see an example.

71
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:54,000
If we are going to insert Z into this
tree, it's greater than N, so we go to the

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,770
right. It's greater than R, so we go to
the right. And now it's greater than x,

73
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,779
and that's a null link to the right of x,
so the search ends there and are, what we

74
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:11,935
want to do is insert Z into that 3-node.
And the way we do it is, first make a

75
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,820
temporary 4-node that replaces that
3-node.

76
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:23,339
And then that's not a 2-3 tree cuz it's
got that one 4-node with three keys and

77
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,705
four links.
But what we can do is split that 4-node

78
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:34,436
and pass the middle key up to its parent.
So split into two 2-node and pass the

79
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:40,502
middle key to the parent.
That's kind of a magical operation and

80
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:45,407
believe me, it's easier to get done in the
implementation than the graphics.

81
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:50,834
But now you can see that, that local
transformation on the 2-3 tree completes

82
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:54,366
the insertion.
Now, if that parent were a 3-node, it

83
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:59,924
would become a temporary 4-node and would
continue the process moving up the tree.

84
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,913
That's a demo of search and insertion in a
2-3 tree.

85
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:06,660
So, let's look at a double split like
that.

86
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,039
So, say we're inserting L in, into this
tree.

87
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:16,296
So, it goes down to the middle, and winds
up needing to be inserted in the, 3-node

88
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:20,035
in the middle.
So we're going to convert that into a

89
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,271
4-node.
Now, L is the middle key of that one,

90
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:29,240
So we're going to split that 4-node into,
two 2-nodes and move L to the parent.

91
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,603
The 4-node had four links, and the two
2-nodes have four lengths, so nothing has

92
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:41,506
to be changed below.
And then this insertion into the parent

93
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:47,510
changed it from a two, a 3-node into a
4-node essentially adding a length cuz of

94
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,666
the split with the two 2-nodes where there
was only one 3-node before.

95
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,726
But now, that's not a 2-3 tree, so we have
to split again.

96
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:02,269
And in this case there is no paren, so we
create a new one and the height of the

97
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:06,717
tree increases by one.
That's the only time the height of a 2-3

98
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:12,418
tree changes, when the roots splits the
height introduces increases by one.

99
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,477
So, that's a demo of insertion into a
3-node at the bottom, in a 2-3 tree that

100
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:24,336
percolates all the way to the top.
Now let's look at constructing a 2-3 tree

101
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:29,569
from an initially empty tree.
So if we start by just inserting a key,

102
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:35,170
well, that just creates a 2-node
containing that key, and that's legal 2-3

103
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,076
tree, so we're fine.
Now, inserting E into that well, it's

104
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:46,003
going to B if it's in the tree left of S,
that's a null lin. So we need to convert

105
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:50,693
that 2-node into a 3-node.
Okay? And that's the legal of 2-3 trees,

106
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:56,239
So we stop inserting A into that.
We convert that 3-node into a temporary

107
00:08:56,586 --> 00:09:01,993
4-node, but then we need to split that
4-node moving E to the parent and that

108
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:07,817
creates a new, root node and increases the
size of the tree by one, But now that's a

109
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:12,960
legal 2-3 tree so we stop.
Insert R into that, it goes to the right

110
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,215
of E.
Convert into a 3-node,

111
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:21,562
Now insert C into that. it goes to the
left of E, has to be joined with A into a

112
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,571
new 3-node.
Again, that's a legal 2-3 tree and we

113
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,327
stop.
Now we insert H, that kind of goes to the

114
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:33,254
right of E.
That 3-node gets converted into a 4-node.

115
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:38,600
That's a temporary 4-node and we split and
move R to the parent,

116
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:44,363
Now that parent's a legal and there's
nothing more to be done.

117
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:48,514
We, have a legal three tree,
2-3 tree. Insert X,

118
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,173
It's bigger than R,
Goes to the right.

119
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:58,120
There's a 2-node, there's room for the X.
Insert P,

120
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,381
That goes between E and R.
The 2-node containing H,

121
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:07,377
Right link is null,
So we convert that 2-node into a 3-node

122
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:12,741
and now we have a legal 2-3 tree.
Now, you, you can see this next insertion

123
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:16,047
is going to cause some splitting wherever
it is.

124
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:19,060
So insert L,
That's between E and R.

125
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,231
So it goes in the, 3-node containing H and
P and we convert that into a temporary

126
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:29,420
4-node.
Split that 4-node, moving L to the parent.

127
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,348
Now that parents of 4-node and that has to
be split,

128
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:38,951
And we create a new root node.
And then the height of the tree grows by

129
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:42,079
one.
And that's a legal 2-3 tree, so we stop.

130
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,536
So, those local transformations,
converting a 2-node to a 3-node or

131
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:52,629
converting a three to a four, and then
splitting and passing a node up.

132
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:58,813
Those are the, only operations we need to
consider to get balance in our search

133
00:10:58,813 --> 00:10:59,900
trees.
Alright.

134
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,326
So as I've mentioned and this diagram
shows, the splitting of 4-node and a 2-3

135
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:11,857
tree is a local transformation.
It only involves changing a constant

136
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:16,169
number of links.
So, in this example, it shows the general

137
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:21,212
situation, when the 4-node to be split is
the middle length,

138
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,872
But the same is true if it's a left or
right.

139
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:28,394
And those six subtrees drawn could be
huge.

140
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:33,904
They could contain millions of keys,
But it doesn't matter what they contain.

141
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:38,833
We don't touch them at all,
Nor do we touch anything above this node

142
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:44,415
in the tree until the split happens.
So the transformation that splits that b,

143
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:50,096
c, d, node and inserts the C into the
3-node at the root, just involves, making

144
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:56,795
that 3-node into a temporary 4-node.
And making that, 4-node into two 2-nodes

145
00:11:56,795 --> 00:12:02,758
and adjusting the lengths appropriately.
Just a constant number of operations and

146
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:09,813
that's why, this operation, is, in
general, efficient. so let's look at the

147
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:17,640
just the global properties that these
manipulations preserve.

148
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:24,707
The two things that are critical is that
the, in a, in a 2-3 tree, we always have

149
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:28,839
symmetric order.
That is the word that we defined, for

150
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:32,652
2-nodes and 3-nodes, and we also have the
perfect balance.

151
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:36,341
The distance from the root to the bottom
is always the same.

152
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:40,891
And to prove that, we just need to show
that each transformation maintains

153
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:45,994
symmetric order and perfect balance, and
these are all the possible transformations

154
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:49,868
that we could do.
If we split the root, then, that's the,

155
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:54,849
what happens at the root, and if there was
perfect balance before, there's perfect

156
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:59,611
balance after, with the height one bigger.
If the parent was a 2-node then the

157
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:04,717
transformation is a local transformation
and if you look at where the links are,

158
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:09,886
then it's easy to see by induction that if
there was perfect balance before there's

159
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:13,996
perfect balance afterward,
Because we didn't change anything about

160
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:16,923
the perfect balance in any of those
subtrees.

161
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:21,344
And that's true in every case.
If the 3-nodes at the right and this one

162
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:25,391
is one higher and those four are one lower
and afterwards it's the same.

163
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:29,813
If there was perfect balance before
there's perfect balance afterwards,

164
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,907
because we didn't change the height of any
nodes.

165
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:35,982
We just moved things around locally within
nodes.

166
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:40,658
And this is when this parent is a 3-node,
then there's the tree cases,

167
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:44,950
If we split up the last split at the
middle and split at the right,

168
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,452
And again, changing the four node to, to a
2-nodes and adding links.

169
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:54,387
If there was perfect balance before,
there's perfect balance after, because we

170
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:57,780
didn't change the heights of anything else
in the tree.

171
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:04,870
So our operations maintain symmetric order
and perfect balance in a 2-3 tree.

172
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:10,592
So, that's going to give us, a very easy
way to describe a performance.

173
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:17,280
The call, or operations have costs that's
proportional to the path link from the,

174
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:23,003
height to the bottom, and every path from
the root to a null link has the same

175
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:25,827
length.
How long can those paths be?

176
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:31,846
Well, it's not hard to see that the, in
the worst case, if they're all 2-nodes,

177
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:35,860
that's the longest they can be is log base
two of N.

178
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,748
Now, and if they're all 3-nodes, it would
be log base three of N, which is less,

179
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:47,567
It's about 0.63 log base two of N.
So, all the paths in a 2-3 tree with N

180
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:53,035
nodes have to have length between those
two bounds and those are pretty small

181
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,813
numbers.
For a million nodes, that's between twelve

182
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,396
and twenty.
And, if, if it's a billion nodes, that's

183
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:04,952
between eighteen and 30.
Those are remarkably small numbers, so

184
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:09,649
we're going to have guaranteed
performance, even for huge databases,

185
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,561
We're going to be able to guarantee that
we can get search and insert them with

186
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,960
just eighteen to 30 operations and it's
quite remarkable, really.

187
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,686
So, here's what our table, will look like,
when we finish the implementation of 2-3

188
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,956
trees.
Every operation is guaranteed to be a

189
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:31,524
constant times log n.
Now, the constant depends on the

190
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:37,693
implementation, exactly what kind of
manipulations we need to do to convert,

191
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:44,327
3-nodes to 4-nodes and so forth.
But it's, easy to see from demo and from

192
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:48,869
the diagrams that those are going to be
constant, guaranteed logarithmic

193
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:54,483
performance for all operations, which is
certainly what we want in a symbol table

194
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,394
implementation Now what about the
implementation?

195
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:02,076
Well, we're actually not going to talk
about a direct implementation of 2-3

196
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:07,354
trees, because it's kind of complicated.
It's cumbersome to maintain multiple node

197
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:10,580
types.
You might need, a multiple compares to

198
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,814
move down the tree.
If there's a two, a 3-node, it takes more

199
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:18,578
compares than a 2-node,
So, it's complicated to analyze.

200
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,821
We have to take track, keep track the
links as we go up and down the tree to

201
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:28,189
take, handle the splitting,
And there's, and there's a lot of cases.

202
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:34,070
I drew all the cases and, and, there's a,
whether you're splitting into the middle

203
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,881
of a 4-node or the right of a 2-node,
there's just a lot of cases.

204
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:42,690
So, you could do it but we're not going to
because there's a much easier way.

205
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,370
So that's 2-3 trees,
A, a model for implementing balanced trees

206
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,960
in guaranteed logarithmic time.
