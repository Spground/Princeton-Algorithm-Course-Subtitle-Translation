1
00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:06,056
Okay, our basic array implementation of
stacks had the defect where we required

2
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:11,610
clients to provide us the maximum capacity
of the stack ahead of time. Now, we're

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,020
going to look at technique for resolving
that problem. How do we, we do not

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,033
implementing the API. The API says we
should just be able to create a stack and

5
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:27,021
it should be able to grow and shrink to
any size. So, how do we going to go and

6
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,632
shrink the array? Well, first thing you
might think of is when the client pushes a

7
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:36,530
new item onto the stack increase the size
of the array by one and when pops,

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,225
decrease the array by one. That's easy to
code up but not worth it because it's much

9
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:46,533
too expensive to do that. The reason is
that you have to create a new array, size

10
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:52,290
one bigger and copy all the items to that
new array. So inserting the first N items

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,361
would take time proportional if the text,
stacks is size N - one, it's going to take

12
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:04,148
time N. And when it's two time N - one so
the first N items will take the sum of the

13
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:10,953
first N integers which we know is about
N^2 / two. Quadratic time to insert N

14
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:16,623
items into a stack that kind of
performance is unacceptable for large

15
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:22,693
problems as we've seen, as we will see
many times. So, the challenge is to do the

16
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:29,227
resizing. But somehow ensured that it
happens and frequently. So, the well end

17
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:35,995
technique for doing that called repeated
doubling is to when the array fills up,

18
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:43,088
create a new array of twice the size and
copy all the items over. Then we don't

19
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:50,773
create new arrays all that often so here's
the implementation of that. We start with

20
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:57,049
an array of size one. If we have a full
stack, which we know by testing N which is

21
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,038
the number of items in the stack versus
the rail length, then we just re-size the

22
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:09,066
array into one of twice the length before
inserting the item. And how do we re-size

23
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:16,312
to a new capacity? We create a new array
of that capacity and just go ahead and

24
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:22,803
copy our current stack into that, into the
first half of that and then retu rn it.

25
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:30,211
And that will reset our instance variable
which is our stack to this new bigger

26
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:37,570
array. So, the idea and the consequence of
this is if you insert N items into an

27
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,675
array, into a stack with this array
representation, the time will be

28
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:50,712
proportional to N not N^2. And the reason
is that you only create a new array every

29
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:57,203
time it doubles but by the time that it
doubles, you've inserted that many items

30
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:04,514
into the stack so on average, it's just
like adding one operation to cost of one

31
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:10,977
to each operation. So, if we just, if we
just calculate the cost and inserting the

32
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:16,179
first N items you're going to have,
instead of the sum of the integers from

33
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:21,689
one end, you're going to have the sum of
the powers of two from one to end and that

34
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:27,284
will give a total cost of about 3N. So,
that's an array axises. For the copy,

35
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:33,009
there's two array axis. So, to insert an
item, its about three array axises. This

36
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,623
plot is another way of looking at it which
is the number of array axis its taken as

37
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:43,883
you implement push operations. Every time
you hit a power of two, you take that many

38
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:48,801
array axises but in the sense you've
already paid for them by putting those

39
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:54,871
items on the stack. So that's called
amortize analysis, where we consider the

40
00:03:54,871 --> 00:04:01,343
total cost averaged overall operations and
this is a, a fine example and useful

41
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:07,377
example of amortize analysis to get
efficiency in a stack implementation. Now

42
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:12,402
we, we have, what about the pop? We have
to think about how to shrink the array.

43
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,589
So, we might think, well, we doubled it
when it was full, when do we cut it in

44
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:23,074
half when it gets to be half full. We
don't want to get the array to get two

45
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:28,934
empty. Well, that one, one doesn't exactly
work because of a, a phenomenon called

46
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:34,553
trashing. If you, if the client happens to
do push, pop, push, pop alternating when

47
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:40,208
the array is full then, it's going to be
doubling, halving, doubling, halving and

48
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:45,308
creating new arrays on every operation to
take time proportional to N for every

49
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:51,069
operation and therefore, quadratic time
for everything so I don't want to do that.

50
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:56,810
The efficient solution is to wait until
the array gets one quarter full before you

51
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,074
have it. And that's very easy to
implement. We'll just test if the arrays

52
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:08,091
one quarter full, if it is, we re-size it
to half full. And so, then at that point,

53
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:15,000
it's half full and you can either grow by
adding stuff or shrink by subtracting

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,009
stuff but there won't be another resizing
array operation until, I guess totally

55
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,880
full or half again full. So the invariant
of that is the arrays always between 25

56
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,390
percent and a 100 percent full, number one
and number two that every time you

57
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,887
re-size, you've already paid for it in the
amortize sense by inserting pushing or

58
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:44,791
popping. So, here's just a what happens to
the array for our small client example and

59
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:50,139
you can see at the beginning, it doubles
from one to two to four but once it gets

60
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,736
to four, it stays once it gets to eight,
it stays to that size for a while even

61
00:05:55,736 --> 00:06:01,632
though there's some of the operations it
doesn't shrink back to four until after

62
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:07,036
there's only two items in there and then
it shrinks and so forth. So, array

63
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:13,130
resizing doesn't happen that often but
it's a very effective a way of

64
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:20,500
implementing the stack API with an array
where the client does not have to provide

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,707
this maximum capacity of the stack but
still were guaranteed that the amount of

66
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:34,110
memory that we use is always only a
constant multiple of the number of items

67
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,570
actually on the stack. So the analysis now
says that the average running time per

68
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,896
operation for whatever the sequence of
operations is the average running time is

69
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:55,489
going to be proportional to a constant.
Now, there is a worst case that is at the

70
00:06:55,489 --> 00:07:01,048
point when the stack doubles, it takes
time proportional to N so it's not quite

71
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:07,823
as good performance as we might like but
it's what we the advantage that we get is

72
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:13,470
ve ry fast pushes and pops just access
array and increment it and very efficient

73
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:19,851
for most operations. And for many, many
clients that's an effective trade off to

74
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:27,065
make. So what about memory usage? Well,
this is the analysis of memory usage for

75
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:35,113
stacks and it's actually less memory than
for strings the amount used is between 8n

76
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:42,528
and 32n depending on how full the array is
and just a quick analysis of the amount of

77
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:50,452
space that arrays take in Java. So, again
this analysis is just for the stack itself

78
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:57,009
not for the strings which the client
wants. So, what are the trade offs between

79
00:07:57,238 --> 00:08:01,906
using a re-sizing array versus a link
list. There's a two different

80
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:07,771
implementations and the same API and the
client can use them interchangeably, which

81
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:13,295
one is better? In many situations, we're
going to have multiple implementation of

82
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:19,117
APIs and depending on properties of the
client program you're going to have to

83
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:24,520
choose which one is the better one to use.
So, for link list every operation takes

84
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,091
constant time in the worst case that's a
guarantee but we have to use a little

85
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:36,001
extra time and space to deal with the
links. So, it's going to be slower.

86
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:42,888
Resizing array implementation we have a
good amortized time so total average over

87
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:48,514
the whole process is good. We have less
wasted space and probably faster

88
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:53,946
implementation of each operation. And so,
for some clients, maybe that makes a

89
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:58,192
difference perhaps, you wouldn't want to
use a re-sizing array implementation at

90
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:02,950
the moment that your plane is coming in
for a landing and you wouldn't wanted to

91
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,929
all of the sudden, not implement some
operations quickly. If you need that kind

92
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,403
or maybe in an Internet switch where
packets are coming through at a great

93
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:15,312
rate, you wouldn't want to be in the
situation where you're missing some data

94
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:19,314
because something got slow all of the
sudden. So, that's a trade off that the

95
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:24,109
client can make if I want that guaranteed,
if I want to be sure that eve ry operation

96
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:29,595
is going to be fast use a link list and if
I don't need that guarantee, if I just

97
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:34,684
care about the total amount of time I'll
probably use the resizing array because

98
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:40,379
the total will be much less because
individual operations are fast. So, even

99
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:49,271
with these simple data structures, we have
really important trade offs that actually

100
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:56,043
make a difference in lots of practical
situations.
