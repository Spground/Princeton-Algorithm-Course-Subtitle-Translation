1
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:08,185
>> Now we'll look at an application of
sorting from the field of computational

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:14,375
geometry for an interesting computation.
If you have a set of N points in a

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:20,476
plane. There's a geometric object called
the Convex Hull which is the smallest

4
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:27,411
polygon that encloses all the points.
There's the Convex Hull for that set of

5
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:31,769
points. [cough] There's a lot of
equivalent definitions of this. Some of

6
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,312
them very mathematical, that extend the
higher dimensions. It's the smallest

7
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:41,196
convex set that contain all the points,
the smallest area of convex polygon

8
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:45,839
enclosing the points. It's a convex
polygon that encloses the points whose

9
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:50,863
vertices points in the set and those are
all equivalent definitions. And what we

10
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:57,059
want to do is given the set of points,
we're going to have a program that can

11
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,304
give us the convex hull. Now, which should
the output of such a program, such a

12
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:09,737
method be? Well, in order to be able to
work with the result, it should be a

13
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:16,959
sequence of vertices that gives us that
polygon if we follow it. If we've got some

14
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,977
points that are on the boundary but aren't
really vertices they shouldn't be

15
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:30,406
included. This points out examples of how
difficult computational geometry can

16
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:35,561
sometimes be because degenerate cases
like these are difficult to deal with in

17
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:40,748
code. We're not going to spend a lot of
time on this, in this lecture. But it's

18
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:46,214
something always to be aware of when
trying to [cough] apply simple algorithms

19
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:51,691
in situations like these that turn out to
be maybe more sophisticated than we might

20
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:56,970
think.
>> [inaudible] the large screen.

21
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:05,247
>> Oh yeah, got you. Mm-hm. Well, there's
actually a way to compute the convex hull

22
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:10,311
just mechanically if you put the nails
around the points and put a rubber band

23
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:15,542
around it, that gives you the convex hull.
Now, we're not going to be able to really

24
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:21,808
implement that in a computer program but
it's surprising how well we can do. Here's

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:27,055
an application where people want to
compute the convex hull. Suppose you have

26
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:33,396
a robot that wants to get from s to t and
there's an obstacle that's defined by some

27
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:39,271
polygon. You wanted be able to go around
the obstacle and it turns out that the

28
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:44,441
shortest path, either it's a straight line
from s to t or it's part of the convex

29
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:49,435
hull and is not hard to see why that might
be true. And there's plenty of other

30
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:55,005
applications where people want to be able
to compute the convex hull. Here's another

31
00:02:55,005 --> 00:03:00,193
application. If you want to find the pair
of points that are the farthest apart in

32
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:04,913
the set of points in the plane, this is
sometimes important in statistical

33
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:10,816
calculation or other applications. They're
on the convex hull. If you have the convex

34
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,625
hull, this computation is easy. [cough]
They're, they're going to be extreme

35
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:21,961
points on the convex hull. So, there's a
lot of geometric properties of the convex

36
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:26,780
hull that we can take advantage of to
develop an algorithm. In here two

37
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,446
properties. Now, these are the things that
have to be proven and we're not going to

38
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:38,582
get into the details of geometric proof
but they're intuitive and certainly have

39
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:44,434
no trouble accepting that these things are
true. One thing is, that you can traverse

40
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:49,629
the convex hull by making only counter
clockwise turns or left turns if you're

41
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,326
looking at the screen here. And the other
thing is that, so if we travel from p to

42
00:03:55,326 --> 00:04:00,841
point 1 then we make a left turn to go
to point 5 or counterclockwise turn and

43
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:06,450
then from there, we go to point 9 and
12 and then we eventually get back to

44
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,905
the start point. The other thing is, if
you take the point with the lowest y

45
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:19,813
coordinate. And then if you look at the
polar angle with respect for every other

46
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:27,705
point with the respect to that one, so the
angle you get from of the x-axis through p up to

47
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:33,898
the point, then the vertices appear in
increasing order of that angle. And again,

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:39,391
that's not, not difficult to see that
that's a fact. And the algorithm that

49
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:45,487
we're going to look at, called the Graham
scan is based on those two facts. It's,

50
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:50,967
the idea is to start with point p, the
one with the smallest y coordinate. Sort

51
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:56,931
the points by polar angle with p where
that is we're just going to consider in

52
00:04:56,931 --> 00:05:02,704
that order. And then we'll just throw away
the ones that do not create a

53
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:09,510
counterclockwise turn and you'll see how
that works when we look at the demo. So we

54
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,744
start at point p. Sort the points by polar
angle with p so that is if we take a, a

55
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:21,873
vertical line and sweep it in a
counterclockwise direction, what order

56
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:27,293
that we hit the points? The first thing we
hit is 0, 1, and then we sweep

57
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:32,849
counterclockwise, we get the 2 and then
3 and 4 and so forth. So, that's

58
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:38,627
the ordering of those points. And so now
we'll just consider those points in order

59
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:45,959
and then take them for the convex hull. At
the beginning, 0->1 is a line that's

60
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,282
on the convex hull. So, the point with the
lowest y coordinates on the convex hull

61
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:57,208
and shows the one that is the smallest
polar angle that creates with the x-axis.

62
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:04,024
So now what about this one - 2? Is that on
the convex hull? Well, as far as we know

63
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:08,931
at this point, it could be, it could be
that the thing is a triangle and 0 is

64
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:14,588
the last point in which case it would be.
But in same with 3. As far as we know,

65
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:21,049
that one could be on the convex hull. But
as soon as we go out to 4 that's not a

66
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:27,702
counterclockwise turn. It's going the
wrong way and essentially what this means

67
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:34,453
is a point 4 is evidence that point,
there is no way the point 3 can be on

68
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:40,928
the convex hull. You can [cough] convince
yourself with that quite easily. So we

69
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:47,054
just throw a point 3 out. It's not on
the convex hull so, and what about the

70
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:52,397
angle from 1 to 2 to 4? That's not
counterclockwise either. It's turning the

71
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:57,114
wrong way and it's turning to the right. So
point 2 can't be on the convex hull

72
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:02,248
either. And indeed if you just draw the
line from 1 to 4, you can see the 2

73
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:07,235
inside so there is no way it could be in
the convex hull. Now that's essentially

74
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:11,665
the proof that you have to have a
counterclockwise turn. So now, we go on to

75
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:16,713
5 - turning the wrong way. So, point 4
can't be on the convex hull. So now we go

76
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:21,889
to 6. As far as we know, it could be, but
as soon as we hit 7, we know that it

77
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,032
can't be cuz that's a right turn. So 6 is
not there. Go to 8, nope. 7 can't

78
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:32,880
be on the convex hull. Go to 9. 8 can't
be on the convex hull. Now we go to

79
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,822
10 and 11. As far as we know they
could be. If 12 weren't there, they

80
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:43,368
would be. As soon as we hit 12 we see
that 11 can't be on the convex hull

81
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:49,404
and 10 can't be on the convex hull and
that completes the computation of the

82
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:54,405
convex hull with the Graham Scan. Okay.
So, there are number of implementation

83
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:59,091
challenges for the Graham Scan and we're
not going to go into detail on this

84
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:03,667
because this is a lecture on sorting
algorithms not computational geometry but

85
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:09,344
it is indicative of how, even if we have a
good sort, we might have to do some extra

86
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:14,715
work to actually solve our problem in an
application. So, how do we find the point

87
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:21,543
with the smallest y coordinate? Well you
could, you could sort, you could define an

88
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:26,593
order and compare the points by y
coordinate so essentially sorting is the

89
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:33,057
[cough] answer to that question. And we'll
look at the next lecture of what it means

90
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:39,893
the divine ordering among objects, little
more general than what we do for sorting.

91
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:46,039
How to sort the points by polar angle?
Well again we need to define what we mean

92
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,447
when we're comparing points. And then the
next lecture again we'll look at ways to

93
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:55,375
define different orderings among points
and Graham scan is a perfect example. We

94
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:00,564
don't want to just be able to sort things,
we don't want to just be able to sort them

95
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:05,156
by defining and compared to. We're going
to be able to sort the same things in

96
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:10,475
different way sometimes and this example
is a fine motivation of that. Figuring out

97
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:16,029
whether what we have is a counter
clockwise turn that's a little exercise in

98
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,729
geometry and we'll just talk about that
briefly in the next couple of slides. And

99
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:26,866
then wow, what are we getting the sort
efficient, done efficiently? Well, we

100
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:32,549
could use Shellsort but actually in the
next couple of lectures and we'll look at

101
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:38,409
classical sorts - Mergesort and Quicksort -
that we could use. The idea though is that

102
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:43,885
this example illustrates that good sorting
algorithm gives us a good convex hull

103
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:48,563
algorithm. That's an extremely important
principle in designing good algorithms.

104
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:52,607
Once we have a good algorithm, if we have
another problem we can say to ourselves,

105
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:56,886
well, we've got a good solution to this
algorithm, can we use that solution to

106
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:02,259
solve our new problem? Convex hull, when
we have a good sorting algorithm, it gives

107
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,722
us a good convex hull algorithm. Because
the main, the most work in convex hull is

108
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:14,078
the sort. And then again there's all, all
kinds of difficulties in implementing

109
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,484
convex hull in real world situations
because of various degeneracies. And these

110
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:26,619
things are covered on the book site. So
the main part of computation that we

111
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:32,458
haven't really talked about and we'll
cover briefly is if we have three points,

112
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:38,931
a, b and c, and you go from a to b to c,
are you making a counterclockwise turn or

113
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:44,664
not? So, in the example at the left, a to
b to c is counterclockwise. Example at the

114
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:50,295
right, a to b to c is not counter
clockwise. Going from a to b you turn left

115
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:55,568
to get to c in the first case and you go
right to get to c in the second case and

116
00:10:55,568 --> 00:11:00,949
we want to do a computation that
distinguishes this. Now, this computation

117
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:06,650
will be pretty easy except for the
degeneracies. What do you want to count if

118
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,734
they're all on the same line. Or if the
slope is infinity. So, you have to just be

119
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:17,081
aware that these situations have to be
dealt with. So, the code isn't quite as

120
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:22,810
simple as you might come up within the
first instance that you try. So, there's

121
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,753
degeneracies to deal with and floating
point precision but people, researchers in

122
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:34,797
computational geometry have worked this
out and actually there's not that much

123
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:41,622
code at all in the end involved. The and
this is the slide that, that gives the

124
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:48,254
math and I won't talk through this math.
If you're interested in implementing this,

125
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:54,659
you can come back to the slide. And it's
essentially based on the idea of computing

126
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,543
the slopes of the lines between a and b,
between a and c and comparing them to

127
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:06,592
decide whether you're turning counter
clockwise or clockwise. And this is the

128
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:13,942
specific math that gets that implemented.
So [cough] this is if we implement a point

129
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:22,060
data type for computational geometry, you
can have a method ccw() that just with this

130
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:30,013
little math calculation (b.x - a.x)(c.y - a.y)
minus (b.y - a.y)(c.x - a.x) and we

131
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:36,047
see that calculation here gives you
immediately whether it's counter

132
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:44,400
clockwise, clockwise or co-linear. Not
much code at all. And that method is the

133
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:53,087
basis for the Graham Scan. The Graham Scan
uses a sort where we give two different

134
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:59,350
ways to sort the points. And that uses a
push down stack for the hull, it puts the

135
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,727
points on the hull in it goes ahead and
for every point considering I'm in the

136
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:12,481
order of the polar sort it'll compare
whether the top two points on the hull and

137
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:19,229
the new point implement a CCW turn or not.
And if it's not a CCW turn, it pops and

138
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:25,799
then continues going. Very little code to
implement the convex hull given that you

139
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:32,179
have a sort and that's our main point for
this lecture - there is many natural

140
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:38,033
applications of sorting but also will be
able to develop new algorithms that use

141
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:51,019
sort that gain efficiency because of the
efficiency of sorting.
