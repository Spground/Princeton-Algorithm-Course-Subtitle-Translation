1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:06,475
Next we're going to consider addressing
another fundamental defect in the

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:11,664
implementations we've considered so far
that those implementations are only good

3
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:16,503
for strings. What if we want to have
queues and stacks of other types of data?

4
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:22,573
And that brings us to the topic of
generics. Alright. So, we implemented

5
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:29,075
stack of strings but in applications we
have all different types of data that we

6
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:35,675
might want to implement like stack of int
say or URLs or cars or vans or whatever

7
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:41,386
data that we might be processing. So how
are we going to implement stacks and

8
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:46,796
queues for that types of data. Well, first
thing that we might that we might consider

9
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,869
and actually we're forced to consider this
one in lots of programming environment, is

10
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,135
to implement a separate stack class for
each type of data that we're using. That

11
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:02,900
really seems unsatisfactory. We have our
carefully crafted code that does array

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,348
resizing and so forth and we're going to
copy that code and change the data type

13
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:15,129
string to the data type van or int to
everywhere. And what if we have hundreds

14
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:21,039
of different types of data that we're
processing. We have hundreds of different

15
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:26,470
implementations. Unfortunately that
situation at the beginning of Java where

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,424
we stuck with that and there are plenty of
programming languages where basically

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,425
we're stuck with that so what we want to
look at is a modern approach to avoiding

18
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:42,509
having multiple implementations for each
type of data. So the a quick hack that is

19
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:51,399
widely used is to use casting to implement
to reuse the code for different data types.

20
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:59,435
So, we make our implementation with type
Object so everything in Java is a sub type

21
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:07,050
of Object and then the client, when the
client comes to use it, will simply cast

22
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,491
the result to the corresponding type. I
don't want to spend a lot of time with

23
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:19,643
this cuz I think this is a unsatisfactory
solution. So, in this example we have two

24
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:25,878
types with two stacks one of apples and
one of oranges. And then, it's up to the

25
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:32,007
client when it pops something off the
apple stacks to cast at the apple to keep

26
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:37,103
the type checking system happy. The
problem with this is that the client code

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,100
has to do this, this casting and it's kind
of an insidious bug if it doesn't quite

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,458
get it. So, the third attempt that we're
going to talk about uses generics. And

29
00:02:51,458 --> 00:03:00,357
that way the client code doesn't do
casting. We can discover mistakes in typed

30
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:08,018
mismatches at compile-time instead of at
run-time. So, in this case, we put, with

31
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:16,698
generics, we can have a type parameter on
our class and that include, that's inside

32
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:24,080
angle brackets in this code and then, we
can [cough] if we have a stack of apples

33
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:32,980
and we tried to push an orange unto a
stack of apples then we're going to get a

34
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,027
compile-time error because that's stack
was declared to only consist of, of

35
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:44,492
apples. And just the guiding principal in
good modular programming is that we should

36
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:51,730
welcome compile-time errors and avoid
run-time errors because if we can detect

37
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,323
an error at compile-time, then we can ship
our product or deploy our implementation

38
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:04,310
our implementation of an API and have some
confident that it's going to work for any

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,664
client whereas, the error is not going to
get discovered until run-time it might

40
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:16,082
occur with some client development. Now,
years after, we have to deploy our

41
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:23,849
software and be extremely difficult on
everyone. Okay. So actually with a good

42
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:32,268
generic implementation it's not difficult
to simply [cough], take every place that

43
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:40,637
we used string and replace it with a
generic type name as in this code here. On

44
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:48,018
the left is our implementation of a stack
of strings using link list. On the right

45
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:53,095
is a generic implementation. So, every
place that we used string type on the

46
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:59,520
left we used the word item on the right.
And at the top, the class declaration we

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,539
declared an angle brackets that item is
the generic type that we're going to use.

48
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:11,836
The implementation could hardly be more
straightforward and it's an excellent way

49
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:18,862
to solve the problem of handling multiple
types of data with one implementation.

50
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:29,269
With arrays, it doesn't quite work and
again all programming languages and, you

51
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:35,404
know, many programming languages nowadays
have difficulties with this and Java's got

52
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:41,231
a particular difficulty. So, what we would
like to do is just declare a new array

53
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:48,057
using our generic name Item as in the
highlighted line here. Otherwise it's the

54
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:55,059
same. Unfortunately, Java does not allow
generic array creation. So there's various

55
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:02,125
technical reasons for that and you can
read, read extensive debates about this on

56
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:08,718
the web that's going to go beyond our
scope. For now, what we need to do is put

57
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:15,322
a cast in to make this work. So, we create
an array of objects and then we cast it

58
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:22,461
down to an array of items. Now in my view,
a good code has zero cast. So, we want to

59
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:28,622
avoid cast as much as possible because it,
it, it really is declaring some kind of

60
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:35,306
weakness in what we're doing. But in this
case we have to put in this one cast and

61
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:41,647
so what we've heard about that is the ugly
cast it doesn't, it doesn't make you feel

62
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:47,734
good about the code. It's not something
that you will come up with on your own and

63
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:52,789
that's, and that's an undesirable feature,
I think for codes so simple as this. But

64
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:58,276
fortunately, we can get through pretty
much everything that we're going to do in

65
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:04,297
this course just knowing about this one of
lay cast. So now, when we compile this

66
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:10,490
program we get a, a warning message from
Java. It says that we're using unchecked

67
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,610
or unsafe operations and we should
recompile with a minus -Xlint equals

68
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,787
unchecked for details. So, we can go ahead
and do that and it says that you have put

69
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:27,247
in, in your code an unchecked cast and
we're warning you about that cuz you

70
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:33,428
shouldn't be putting in unchecked cast.
And okay, that's fine and you're going to

71
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:40,014
see that when you do compiles using code
like these. I, I think maybe they might

72
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:45,494
have added to this warning statement "We apologize for making you do this". It's

73
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:51,770
not our fault that we had to do that, we
had to do that cuz of your requirement

74
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,908
about not allowing us to declare generic
arrays. So with that note please don't

75
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:03,915
think there's something wrong with your
code if you follow our prescriptive and,

76
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:10,596
and get this warning message. Okay then,
it's one of the detail that Java takes

77
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:19,274
care of and that's what about primitive
types [cough] so the generic type that

78
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:26,636
we're using is for objects and you know,
we're casting down from array of objects.

79
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:34,517
So in order to handle generic types we
have to use Java's wrapper object types.

80
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:40,751
So Integer with the capitalized rapid type
for int and so forth and many of you were

81
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:46,419
probably familiar with that. And there's a
process called auto-boxing which

82
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:51,827
automatically cast between primitive types
and wrappers so all of that handles of

83
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:57,633
the, the problem of dealing with primitive
types, kind of behind the scenes. And the

84
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:04,693
bottom line is that we can articulate an
API for generic stacks that works for any

85
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:10,665
type of data and we've got two
implementations, link list and arrays

86
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:20,867
that, that performed very well for [cough]
any type of data using the, the resizing

87
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:26,035
or link list as we've described.
