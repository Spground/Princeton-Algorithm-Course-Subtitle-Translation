1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:07,017
Now, let's look at a dictionary client,
another very useful and common application

2
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:13,336
of symbol tables. So, in this case, we are
going to write a client called Lookup CSV

3
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,166
that [cough] is going to take three
arguments. The first will be a file name,

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:24,924
a so-called common separated value file
and the next two arguments are integers

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:32,660
which will tell us what to treat as keys
and values in the file. In this example or

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,055
CSV file relates URLs to IP addresses. So,
each line has a URL and IP address and are

7
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:45,089
separated by commas. And in general, a CSV
file might have many fields separated by

8
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:50,838
comma, comma. So, we number them zero,
one, and so forth starting from the left.

9
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:57,157
So, what we are going to do with this
client is specify with integers which

10
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:03,778
field is the key, and which is the value.
So, if we call this client with second

11
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:09,849
argument zero and third argument one, that
means we want to use the URL field zero on

12
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:15,854
the CSV file as the key, no one use the IP
address that's field one in the CSV as the

13
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:21,633
value, you want to associate keys with
values. So the client will build a symbol

14
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:27,602
table that makes us associations for every
line in the file and this could be huge

15
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:34,836
file. And then, if we want to look up the
IP address associated with a given URL we

16
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:41,698
can just type in URLs and the client will
return the IP address, it'll do the look

17
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:48,539
up. So, Adobe.com has got this IP address
that's shown if this line here in the

18
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:55,145
table, and so forth. Princeton.edu has
this IP and ebay.edu is not in the file.

19
00:01:55,145 --> 00:02:00,898
Now, on the other hand, we could, from
this same file, we could build a symbol

20
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:07,277
table where we treat the IP address as
the, as the key and the URL as the value.

21
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:13,180
So, in that case, it'll build a symbol
table with IP addresses as keys and we can

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,223
type in an IP address and get the
associated URL. So, with one client we can

23
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:27,473
handle lookups of all kinds in CSV files.
For example, here's another CSV file that

24
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:36,056
from biology that deals with, amino acids
and codons and names. So, in this case,

25
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:44,332
the first field is three letters from the
DNA sequence which, represents a codon.

26
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:51,926
And certain codons have names, that's the
amino acids. So, TCC is called serine, and

27
00:02:51,926 --> 00:03:01,152
so forth. And that's an association that's
well known to biologist and then you can

28
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:08,259
use this lookup CSV client to quickly get
the name associated with any given codon.

29
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:14,773
That's just another simple example. This
is a very general tool. Any CSV file, you

30
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:21,389
can pick any field as the key, any other
field as the value. So here's still

31
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:28,091
another example where we might use for a
class list, which has the person's year of

32
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:36,046
graduation, last name, first name precept
name and login name. And so in the first

33
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:43,006
call over here, we might use the login
name as the key and the first name as the

34
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:48,027
value. So, we type in somebody's login
name we get their first name. And again,

35
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:53,061
with the same client login is key and get
the section as a value. So, all kinds of

36
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:58,069
information processing that we might need
to do for large amounts of data,

37
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,476
represented in comma, comma separated
value files this one client which is based

38
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:08,099
on a symbol table will provide useful
functionality. And here's the

39
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,039
implementation there's very little to it
given the symbol table API that we've

40
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:20,062
articulated and the implementations that
we have. So what do we do to get lookup

41
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:27,069
CSV implemented? Well, first thing is to
set up the input stream from the first

42
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:33,675
argument, so that's our input file. And
then, get the numbers of the fields, so

43
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:39,072
the key and the value. And now build a
simple table that associates strings with

44
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:46,007
strings. Then there there's a while loop
where we just read a new line in that read

45
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:51,675
line, read line and then split according
to comma into tokens in an array. And

46
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:57,549
then, the index in the array is going to
build the fields that we're going to use.

47
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:03,496
So, the key is the string in the key field
entry of the array, and the value is the

48
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:08,517
string in the value field entry in the
array, and we simpl y put that into symbol

49
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:14,362
table. So, this value loop just builds the
symbol table from the file. Then from

50
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:20,108
standard input we take queries, just read
a string, check if the symbol table

51
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:26,177
contains the string. It, it doesn't, print
not found. And if it does, print the value

52
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:31,091
associated with the key. So, a very small
amount of code based on a symbol table

53
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:40,034
implementation that gives us the
dictionary functionality.
