1
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:08,005
Next we're going to look at an easy
application of sorting to related problem

2
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:14,025
called Shuffling. So, suppose you have a
deck of cards. One of the things that you

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:20,004
might want to try to do is to simply
rearrange those cards into random order,

4
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:25,558
that's called shuffling. Here's a way to
get shuffling done using a sort and seems

5
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:31,545
like the opposite. The idea is, just
generate a random real number for every

6
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:37,364
array entry and then sort using those
random numbers as the keys. That's an

7
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:44,808
effective way to get things shuffled. And
it's possible to prove that, that produces

8
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:49,217
a uniformly random permutation of the
input if there's no duplicate values,

9
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:54,615
assuming that you have a real numbers that
are generated uniformly at random. And

10
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:59,917
that's just means that it's well shuffled
that every possible way of shuffling the

11
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,144
deck appears with the equal probability.
That's fine but it requires a sort and a

12
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:09,948
sort seems like a lot of work for this
problem and the question is, can we do

13
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:14,704
better? Can we have a faster way to
shuffle? Do we really need to pay the cost

14
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:19,430
of a full sort? The answer to that
question is, no. There's actually a very

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,674
easy way to rearrange an array so that
the result is a uniformly random

16
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:33,054
permutation. It only require a linear time
to get the job done. Let's look at the

17
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:40,235
demo. The idea this to pass through the
array from left to right with an index i

18
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:46,765
as we've been doing but now we start with
the array in order. And actually, it

19
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:53,253
doesn't matter how we start the array and
every time we pick an integer between

20
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:59,418
0 and i uniformly at random and, and
swap a[i] with that integer. So, let's

21
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:05,584
look at the beginning, we don't do
anything just swap it with itself. Now,

22
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:11,586
with i = 2 or i pointing to the second
card we generate a random integer in

23
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:18,375
between 0 and i, in this case it's the
one to the left and we swap those.

24
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:24,660
Increment i, generate a random integer,
this time it's going to be the first one

25
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,952
again, swap them. Increment i, generate a
random integer, swap them. Increment i,

26
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:38,833
generate a random integer, swap them. And
continue in that way. Swap. So for every

27
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:47,422
i, we do exactly one swap. Now, card could
be involved in more than one swap but

28
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:55,151
that's not an issue. The point is that the
cards to the left of i are shuffled there

29
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:02,136
uniform, randomly shuffled. On this case,
i and r are the same. There's no swap.

30
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:09,764
Increment i, generate a random r, swap them.
And at the end we have the deck shuffled.

31
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:16,472
That's a linear time shuffling algorithm
making use of randomness. It was proved

32
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:22,530
through actually a long time ago even
before computer implementations that if

33
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,546
you do that, you get a uniformly random
permutation and it only takes linear time.

34
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:36,148
So, that's definitely a way to get a deck
shuffled quite easily. Easy to implement.

35
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:44,799
Now it's key that the uniform random
number will be between 0 and i-1. You'll

36
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,477
often see programmers thinking that
they're implementing a shuffle and they

37
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:56,756
just choose for every entry, they just
choose random place in the array to

38
00:03:56,756 --> 00:04:03,530
exchange it with and that doesn't really
work. You could do the items between i and

39
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,296
n-1, the ones that you haven't seen
yet and that would also work but doing a

40
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:15,694
whole array doesn't give you a uniformly
random result. So, with that one caveat,

41
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:22,511
this code is almost trivial. And it's a
method in our standard random class. Now

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,984
if you're going to be using random methods
that depend on randomness in real

43
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:35,204
applications, you do have to be careful.
So this is just an example about software

44
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:41,332
security. There's a lot of difficult and
deep issues to worry about and so for our

45
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:46,937
security and we're not going to worry
about all of them. But one thing that we

46
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:52,698
can do is make sure that our algorithms
work as advertised. So, here's an example

47
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:59,123
of an implementation for online poker.
Here's the code that you can find on the

48
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:06,712
web for how to shuffle a deck of cards and
that's pretty similar to our code but it's

49
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:15,458
actually got a few bugs, more than a few
bugs. So first one is the way that random

50
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:23,473
works it's actually never gets to 52 which
means that the last card just stays it can

51
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:29,798
end up in the last place. So, it's
definitely not shuffled because of that.

52
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:37,761
Maybe that one's minor but it also is
picking a random card from the whole deck

53
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:45,504
as we just pointed out that's not uniform.
Should be between 1 and i or between

54
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:53,210
i+1 and 52. Another problem is in
this implementation that the random uses

55
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:59,972
just a 32 bit seed that if you do that,
there's not enough possible shuffles. The

56
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:05,999
number of possible shuffles is, is, is
much more, if n, if n is 52, it's 52

57
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:11,828
factorial which is a lot bigger than two
to the 32nd. So, it's not close to a

58
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:17,767
random or uniform. And the other thing is
that, the seed is just a number of

59
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:23,085
milliseconds since midnight and that cuts
down the number of shuffles even more. And

60
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:28,629
in fact, it didn't take that much hacking
for someone to realize that after seeing

61
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,974
five cards and figuring out what the
server clock was doing, you could get all

62
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:39,016
the future cards in a real time in a program.
And that's a pretty tough thing to have

63
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:44,666
happen if you're implementing online
poker. You might want to make sure that if

64
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:49,769
you're advertising that you're doing a
random shuffle, that you go ahead and do

65
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:56,694
so. And the famous quote in this many
similar quotes, the generation of random

66
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:03,108
numbers is too important to be left to
chance. So, if your business does depend

67
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:10,039
on shuffling people have looked at all
sorts of options including using hardware

68
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,466
random number generators and these
various tests available to make sure that

69
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:21,866
it's random and you'd better use good
shuffling code that's our topic but the

70
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:29,018
bottom line is don't think that it's easy
to shuffle a deck of cards. So that's

71
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:40,060
shuffling - our first non-trivial sorting
application.
