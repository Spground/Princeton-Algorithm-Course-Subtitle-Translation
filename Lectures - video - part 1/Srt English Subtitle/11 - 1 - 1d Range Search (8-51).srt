00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:09,019
Welcome back. Today, we're gonna take a
look at a number of interesting

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:15,011
applications of symbol tables and the
binary search tree data structure to

3
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:21,413
address problems with processing geometric
data. So let's take a look at it. The idea

4
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:27,378
is that we're gonna be talking about
geometric objects, not simple keys like

5
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:33,338
strings and numbers. So here's an example.
So say your geometric objects are points

6
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:38,346
in the plane and you specify a rectangle
that's oriented with the

7
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:43,404
horizontal/vertical axes. And you might
wanna ask, which points are inside the

8
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:48,200
rectangle or how many points are inside
the rectangle? Or maybe what you are

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,011
processing is rectangles. You have a set
of rectangles, and we want to know which

10
00:00:54,011 --> 00:01:00,291
of these rectangles intersect? Or how many
rectangles intersections are there? These

11
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:05,837
are interesting problems that have lots
and lots of applications, from

12
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:11,806
computerated design, to games and movies
and also in abstractions such as data

13
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:17,849
bases and other situations where you might
have multiple keys or multiple dimensions.

14
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:24,856
And it's a very interesting extension of
the ideas that we've looked at for symbol

15
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:30,175
tables for all sorts of familiar
applications. And, surprisingly binary

16
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:34,300
search trees and these associated
algorithms that we've looked at are going

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,774
to provide very efficient solutions to a
number of important problems in this area.

18
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:45,943
And really have enabled a new developments
and new technology in all of these kinds

19
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:51,135
of applications. So, to get started, we're
going to look at a simple problem called

20
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:56,761
one-dimensional range search. And it
really forms the basis for what we're

21
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:02,146
going to do. It's a little bit of an
extension of the ordered symbol table API

22
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:07,837
that we gave before and we're going to
have operations range-search and

23
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:12,797
range-count. So, a one-dimensional just
means we have one key, so we'll insert a

24
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:19,116
key value pairs before and what we want to
do is to be able to search for a key, and

25
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:24,770
a value associated with it, want to b e
able to delete. But then we want these

26
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,703
operations range-search and range-count.
So, find all the keys that are between two

27
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:36,083
given keys, or give how many keys are
there between two given keys. So, for this

28
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:42,251
example at right we have insert a number
of keys and, and we're just showing them

29
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:47,992
in sorted order. But then, you might say,
well, how many keys are there that are

30
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:53,780
between g and k? In this case, there's
just two. And then the client might say,

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,598
well, what are those keys and you want to
be able to return them. And this is a very

32
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:06,010
common operation, say, in databases. You
want to return how many taxpayers have

33
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,335
salaries between one million and ten
million and then which ones are they and

34
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:17,431
so forth. So, range searching is a very
important fundamental operation. Now, in

35
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:23,459
geometric interpretation, we just think
that the keys as points on a line. And so,

36
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,627
the key values well, are just specified as
points on a line. We might convert the

37
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:34,856
letters to numbers, or we might, keys
might be numbers. And then, what we're

38
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:41,119
looking for is to find or count the points
in a given interval in one dimension. So

39
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:47,272
how we're going ti implement that? Well
this is the basic problem that is very

40
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:52,356
similar to our symbol table problem. We
might consider keeping the things in an

41
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:57,529
unordered array. Just put them in an
array, and then, well, insertion is, is

42
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:03,254
fast. We just add it to the end of the
array. We might have to use resizing to

43
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:08,371
make the array grow. But this is
unattractive because for large numbers of

44
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:13,899
keys, in order to count the keys that fall
within a given range, you have to go

45
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:19,711
through all the keys and test whether
they're in the range or not and to return

46
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:26,043
them the same way. So take linear time for
large number of keys. If you keep the

47
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:32,638
things in order like in a binary search
situation then to insert in order to keep

48
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:38,591
it in order in an array, you might need to
move the larger ones over one pos ition

49
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:44,209
and so forth or elementary implementation
of binary search when we did symbol tables

50
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:49,662
did this. So, the insertion time might be
linear, but then you can use binary

51
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:55,329
search, to look for the two endpoints,
that's only going to take time

52
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:00,631
proportional to log in. And then from
that, you can figure out how many keys

53
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:06,243
there are or return them all between the
index, the lowest one in the range, index

54
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:12,027
the highest one in the range. So, those
elementary implementations are no

55
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:18,179
acceptable for a large numbers of keys cuz
they have the linear time operation. So,

56
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:24,035
what we really want is to have time
proportional to log in. For insert and,

57
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:29,186
and for counting. For range search, of
course, we, we have to touch every key

58
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:35,413
that we return, so the running time is
going to be proportional to the number of

59
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:43,042
keys that match. But anyway, those are
reasonable goals. And they're easy to

60
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:51,545
achieve. So [cough] so, for example what
about one-dimensional range counting?

61
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:58,014
Well, what we're going to do is just keep
the keys in a binary search tree and we

62
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:03,484
looked at the implementation of the rank
function for binary search trees where for

63
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:09,342
every key, we can compute how many keys
are there that are strictly less than that

64
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:15,508
key. So in this case, the rank of e is two
and h is three and so forth. So, in a

65
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:21,413
binary search tree, those rank numbers go
in an increasing order as we do in an

66
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:27,662
ordered traversal and that's easy to
compute. You need to keep that rank tree

67
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:33,813
as a field, or keep a field which has the
size of the tree and it's easy to complete

68
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:40,760
the rank from that. So how many keys
between, say e and s? Well one, two,

69
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:51,297
three, four, five. It's actually just the
difference between the ranks plus one if

70
00:06:51,623 --> 00:07:00,361
the high [cough] entry in the range query
is in the table and not +one over. So,

71
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:08,274
there's the same number of keys between e
and s as there are between e and t five.

72
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:15,192
Between f and t, there's only f our. So,
that's a, a really 1d range count is a

73
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:22,412
very easy computation to perform in, in
log time with a binary search tree. The

74
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:28,297
[cough] number of nodes examined when we
do a search is the length of the search

75
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:33,789
path to low plus the length of the search
path to high to [cough] find their ranks

76
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:39,595
and that's going to be time proportional
to log N. [cough]. So and a range search.

77
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:46,018
Well, we just do a recursive search and to
find all the keys between low and high you

78
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:51,472
look in the left subtree if any of them
could fall in the range. You look at the

79
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:57,106
current node and you look at the right
subtree, if any of them could fall in the

80
00:07:57,106 --> 00:08:02,555
range. And it's easy to tell whether any
of them could fall in the range by just

81
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:08,476
checking whether they're range overlaps
the root or not. So, if we are looking for

82
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:14,469
all the keys between f and t then we have
to look at both the subtrees of the root

83
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,643
s. But we don't to look at the left
subtree of e because all of those are less

84
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:26,018
than e and therefore are less than f. So,
we don't have to have to look there. But

85
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:31,419
otherwise, it's a simple modification of
recursive tree search to find all the keys

86
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:37,702
and it's easy to see the running time to
that is going to be proportional to the

87
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:47,518
number of keys returned plus log N. So,
that's one dimensional range search using

88
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:51,040
binary search trees.
