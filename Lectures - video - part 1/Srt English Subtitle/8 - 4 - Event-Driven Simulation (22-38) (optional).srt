1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:07,035
Now, look at an interesting application of
priority queues that is actually

2
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:11,901
representative of whole family of a
critically important applications in

3
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:18,810
applications of computing. It's called
event driven simulation. And the idea is

4
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:26,739
we want to study some property of the
natural world by simulating it. And that's

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,013
something that's very, very common in, in
scientific inquiry nowadays. And this is a

6
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:40,369
very natural idea. And actually, the idea
goes back to Einstein. So, we want to

7
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:46,198
simulate the motion of N moving particles
that might collide with the priority.

8
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:53,035
This, this kind of stimulation is enabled
by priority queues. And without something

9
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:58,744
like priority queues, you couldn't do this
for a large number of particles because it

10
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:05,215
would require quadratic time and simply
can't be afforded for a huge number of

11
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:11,225
particles. So, and let's take a look at
how we can possibly make this happen. So

12
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:16,532
we use a simple scientific model called
the hard disc model. And then, this is

13
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:22,136
just for simplicity to get this done and
just part of a lecture. Clearly, these

14
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:27,971
things can be extended in many ways. So,
we're going to have moving particles that

15
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:33,034
either collide with each other and with
the walls. And each particle is a disc

16
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:38,776
that's got known position, velocity, mass,
and radius. And there's no other forces

17
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:43,258
involved. It gets more complicated if
there's more forces, like gravity

18
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:49,783
involved. And this point by itself is very
significant. As I mentioned, it goes back

19
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:56,017
to the study of physics with [cough] the
trying to understand the pressure and

20
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:02,031
temperature in Einstein's famous
experiment on a pollen grain showing that

21
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:08,678
their motion was brownian and random. So
whether it's individual atoms and

22
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:14,784
molecules or some bigger kinds of
particles. It's a complex dynamic

23
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:21,340
situation that is better understood
through computer simulation. And nowadays

24
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:28,480
that means priority queues. [cough] So, as
a wa rm-up, here's code to implement

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:37,862
bouncing balls without the collisions. And
this is an elementary programing exercise

26
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:46,888
that is the, the code at the left has the
effects shown at the right. So, we have a

27
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:55,341
data type called ball that represents just
one of the particles and has instance

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:02,137
variables that has the position and the
velocity. So, that's why we make a bunch

29
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:10,466
of them and then we have a, a while loop
which is just every 50 milliseconds clear

30
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:18,072
the, the whole drawing and then move the
balls a little bit and then draw them in

31
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:26,238
their current position. And then the only
to move [cough] operation does is to

32
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:33,465
update the position of the ball by the
velocity, which is just another number and

33
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:38,938
then it does the bouncing off the walls.
If it happens to hit the left of the wall

34
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:44,371
then you reflect the x-coordinate in the
right wall, you reflect the x-coordinate

35
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:48,818
bottom to top, you do the same for the
y-coordinate. So, this the is an easy

36
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:54,423
programming exercise given the right
display primitives. And it's a good

37
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,391
exercise in object-oriented programming
showing how just one implementation then

38
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:05,575
we can use that same implementation to
simulate a number of instances. So, that's

39
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:13,025
our starting point in terms of the code.
So this is the implementation of the ball

40
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:19,981
class. So, it's got position and velocity
as I mentioned, and every ball has a, a

41
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:25,362
radius. And then there is a constructor
and maybe we have a constructor that takes

42
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:30,176
arguments that would initialize the
position and the velocity or maybe

43
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:35,248
initialize them to a random position if
there's no arguments. And then, here's the

44
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:40,394
move method. And the move method again,
most of the times, just takes the x and y

45
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:46,564
coordinates and adds the current velocity
times the speed constant. The dt speed,

46
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:52,007
speed variable that's given as argument
dt. And then these tests are for whether

47
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:57,561
it hits the walls in which case, you have
to flip the x or y velocity. And then

48
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:03,767
draw, it's just using standard draw. Just
draw the ball. So, that's all the code for

49
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:09,349
doing the bouncing ball simulation. Now,
what's missing in this is what happens

50
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:15,715
when the balls collide with each other.
And to cope with that we need to do both.

51
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:22,521
A little bit of high school Physics and a
little bit of basic Computer Science. The

52
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:28,269
Physics problem is exactly what happens
when two balls hit and they bounce off

53
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:33,402
each other according to some
well-understood physical process, and

54
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:39,507
that's the high school Physics. And the CS
problem is how and when to we exactly do

55
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:45,957
these computations for each of the balls.
And how can we do it efficiently that is

56
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:51,619
in, in log N time versus quadratic time.
Because if we have a computational process

57
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:56,860
that takes quadratic time, then it's not
going to scale, we're not going to be able

58
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,489
to do large number of particles.
Simulations in the real world, usually, we

59
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:06,124
wind up doing huge amounts of data and we
cannot have a quadratic algorithm. This is

60
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:11,363
just first indication of that of why if
you want to do this simulation, you better

61
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:16,086
know about some data structure like
priority queues. If you try to do it

62
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:21,639
without it, you're not going to be
successful. Alright, so, let's take a look

63
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,967
at what happens. So there's a number of
things that you might consider trying. So,

64
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:35,692
one idea is the so-called time driven
simulation. And we just say, we're going

65
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:42,597
to update everything every dt seconds.
Then we go ahead and then we could check

66
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:48,123
if there's a collision, if the two balls,
pieces of the two balls are occupying the

67
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:53,250
same space. And if there is, then we could
roll back time just a little bit and I'll

68
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,297
try to figure out exactly, the moment of
which they collided and then figure out

69
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:02,904
how the position and velocity should
change accordingly and then continue the

70
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:08,501
simulation. But this has a huge problem.
The first one is that you have t o check

71
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:13,431
all pairs of balls for overlap so that's
quadratic, so it's going to be really,

72
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:19,504
really lot of overall texture you're not
going to be able to do it for a huge, huge

73
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:26,034
value of N. But the other thing is even if
N is small if you do a very small dt, then

74
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:32,246
you're just doing this calculation over
and over again and there's just too much

75
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:38,556
computation moving the balls little bit at
a time. On the other hand, if you try to

76
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:45,620
improve things by making dt too large you
might completely miss a collision as shown

77
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,167
in the example at right. So figuring out
the value of dt that would really work is

78
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:56,850
a huge problem for the time driven
simulation. Instead, what we want to do is

79
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,416
called an event driven simulation. And
this is a very general concept that's

80
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:08,175
useful in all kinds of context. And we are
going to change things when something

81
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:13,110
happens. So, since the only thing that
matters is collisions, we are going to

82
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,574
figure the particles move in a straight
line, between collisions. And what we are

83
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:22,049
going to do is focus only on the times
when the collisions are going to occur.

84
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:26,680
And the way we are going to that, is to
maintain a priority queue and that

85
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,771
priority queue is going to have all the
possible collisions that could happen in

86
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:37,081
the future and they're going to be
prioritized by time. And when we remove

87
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:42,521
the minimum element from the priority
queue, that's the next collision that we

88
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:48,035
have to deal with. And so we have two
phases, we have prediction and resolution.

89
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:53,448
So, that's sometime t, we can take two
particles. We know their position and

90
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:59,114
velocities shown at the bottom here and we
can predict exactly the moment, which

91
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:05,297
they'll collide assuming that something
else doesn't happen to them in between and

92
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:10,979
then so they will put that predicted
collision time on the priority queue and

93
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:17,152
later on, when that time comes to pass we
will be right at moment when they collide

94
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:22,457
and we can figure out what to do. Now,
there is a possibly that something else

95
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:27,211
happened to t hem in between and we'll
talk about that change, too. So, we have

96
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:32,575
to do collision prediction, which is given
position, velocity, and radius when's it

97
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:37,972
going to hit with another particle or, or
the wall. And then there's resolution

98
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:46,258
which is to figure out how to change the
velocities of the particles according to

99
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:53,791
physical laws. Now this part I'm not going
to talk about in that much detail right

100
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:59,975
now because it's high school Physics. And
so, I think most students have had high

101
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:06,327
school Physics and will be able to do, do
this Math or at least be convinced that

102
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:12,354
the code that does this Math is correct.
So, if you know that you have a particle

103
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:18,733
that's at a certain position or x or y and
has got a certain velocity, the x in the

104
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:25,076
x-direction and y in the y-direction, then
you can from the distance to the pro,

105
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:31,248
vertical wall you can figure out how many
seconds this is going to take until it

106
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:37,011
hits it. It's basically that distance
divided by the by the velocity. And so

107
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:42,600
that's the prediction. And then, the
resolution. When it hits the wall is, is

108
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,586
just going to change the velocity. So
that's in, you know what the position is.

109
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:54,909
So that's just an example of collision, of
collision prediction, when's it going to

110
00:10:54,909 --> 00:11:01,148
hit the wall and resolution what do you do
when it gets to the wall. When you have

111
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:06,671
two particles there's definitely more
math. And again, this is high school

112
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:13,109
Physics. And we're not going to test on it
or even go through the details. But it's

113
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:19,031
just a little bit of arithmetic with the
velocities and positions to deal with what

114
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:24,112
happens when, when how to predict when a
given particle is going to collide with

115
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:28,186
another given particle knowing their
velocity and position. So, you have to

116
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:33,772
take both velocities and divide their
distance by those and, and so forth. So

117
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:41,520
there's simple formulas to tell us what to
do and we can also figure out the formulas

118
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,904
for what we do o nce they do collide. And
again nobody's claiming that this is easy

119
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:53,722
but this is the Physics part and it's
worked out and it comes from Newton's

120
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:59,962
Second Law. And, and, anybody taking high
school Physics will, be able to deal with

121
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:06,359
these formulas and the rest of this may
have to go to a reference book to get up

122
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:11,799
to speed on them. [cough] but once it's
reduced to code we can be, it might have

123
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,947
some trouble debugging at first but at
least we can be convinced that it works.

124
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:23,104
But now, let's look at the computer
science code. So, this is just extending

125
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:30,106
our ball data type that we use for the
bouncing balls that didn't collide to take

126
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:35,324
in, into account these extra things. So,
ours will have mass, so there will be some

127
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:40,962
big heavy ones that make things more
interesting. And there's also a variable

128
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:46,141
called count, which is the number of
collisions of particles have been involved

129
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:51,921
in. And that's useful for a couple of
purposes. So, we're going to need a bunch

130
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:57,701
of procedures which do the prediction and
the collision resolution. I want, what's

131
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:03,710
the, given a particle what's the time till
we hit that particle? What's the time till

132
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,192
we hit vertical horizontal wall? And the
same thing is if we're at the point where

133
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:14,080
we're hitting a particle, what would we
do, the, the same way with the vertical

134
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,899
and horizontal wall. So, that's the
skeleton. We need those procedures that

135
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,760
implement those Physics rules for every
particle. And, and this is what they look

136
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,547
like and again this is high school Physics
so we're not going to do it in detail

137
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:35,184
other than to point out it's really not a
huge amount of code. Lots of the xs and

138
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:41,168
the ys and the vs but really not a huge
amount of code. And the other point is

139
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:47,053
we're going to return infinity if there's
no collision at all so that it's going to

140
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:51,710
keep, keep that on the priority queue,
that ran on the priority queue forever.

141
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:59,105
Okay, so that's the procedures that we
need and then they're similar ones for the

142
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:07,618
horizontal and vertical walls. So now,
let's look at the main loop for the event

143
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:14,846
driven simulation. So, the first thing is
we're going to for every particle we're

144
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:20,275
going to compute the next time that it
might hit every horizontal and vertical

145
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:25,567
wall. Well, actually if it's going away
from a wall, it's not going to hit it so

146
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:30,987
that would be infinity. But if it's going
towards a wall, then we'll compute the

147
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:36,367
time. And then that's a time in the future
and we'll put that event on the priority

148
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:41,437
queue with that time as the key. And then,
we'll do the same thing for all pairs of

149
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:47,084
particles. So, we do have a quadratic
initialization phase that we perform just

150
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:51,881
once to get the priority queue filled up.
Now, all collisions are, might not happen

151
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:57,266
so we might have two particles that are on
a collision course that and we're going to

152
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:01,897
predict that point for both of those
particles, you know, even right at the

153
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:07,235
beginning. But it might be the case that
there's a third particle that knocks one

154
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:12,431
of those out before that thing happens and
that event would be invalidated. So, the

155
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:18,880
simulation has to be careful to take that
into account. But that's not difficult to

156
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,856
do. So, here's what the main loop is. So,
we're going to take the next event from

157
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,782
the priority queue. That's the next
collision that's going to happen from all

158
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:33,618
our calculations. There's one collision
that's going to happen next. Then, we test

159
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:39,518
whether that event has been invalidated.
And we do that by using that count field

160
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:45,289
in the particle. So, then that tells us
what time it's going to be next. So, then

161
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:49,766
we have to go through all the particles
and change their positions on a straight

162
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:53,894
line trajectory, where would they'll be
after that much time? Then we have to take

163
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:59,040
the two particles that collide and change
their velocity. They bounce off one

164
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,014
another. Now those two particles'
velocities have changed , essentially that

165
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:08,095
invalidates the future collisions
involving those. And then we, what we have

166
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:13,094
to do is for those two particles is go
through and predict the future collisions

167
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:18,069
with any walls and collisions with any
other particles. And put all those new

168
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,742
events on to the priority queue. But
that's it. You got two particles, change

169
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:28,021
your velocities figure out the future
collision of those particles with the wall

170
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:33,036
and update the priority queue and then the
main loop is take the next thing off the

171
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:42,017
priority queue and keep going. That's the
code that we'll look at next. So we have

172
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:47,686
a, a, a bunch of conventions just to
reduce the code. And if we this the, the

173
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:55,084
thing called event which involves it says
between two particles, something is going

174
00:16:55,084 --> 00:17:01,086
to happen at a certain time and we're
going to adopt the conventions that, if,

175
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:07,048
neither particle is null then we're
talking about two particles. If one of the

176
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:12,838
particles is null then we're talking about
a wall, a vertical or horizontal wall. And

177
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:18,607
if both particles are null we're saying we
just want to redraw things. That's a bit

178
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:25,231
of a hack, but it cuts down on a lot of
code. Our compared to is by time. And then

179
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:33,018
again, we need an, is valid to check about
intervening collision. And then here's the

180
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:40,763
skeleton of what's going to happen with
the collision system which is the key

181
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:48,987
thing is this prediction method that takes
a particle as argument, and adds to the

182
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:54,148
priority queue, all the possible
collisions involving this particle. So,

183
00:17:54,148 --> 00:18:00,369
it's going to go through every particle
and call the time to hit method for that

184
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:06,776
particle. And then, it'll put an event on
the priority queue for that time, this

185
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:12,695
particle with that particle. And then,
it'll also put an event for the vertical

186
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:19,293
wall and the horizontal wall, again, using
this null convention to say that the event

187
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:26,002
second argument null is vertical. First
argument null is horizontal. So that's a

188
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:31,385
key method t hat gets used in the
simulation for each of the two particles

189
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:38,129
that are going to collide. So, now we can
look finally at the main event driven

190
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:45,613
simulation loop. So there's build a
priority queue. There's do this prediction

191
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:53,936
for every one of the particles. And then,
also we're going to put as the first thing

192
00:18:53,936 --> 00:19:01,135
that happened always a, an event that says
redraw everything. So that's just a, a way

193
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:08,856
of make suring that the simulation keeps
proceeding. It's an easy way to get things

194
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:15,997
drawn. Okay. So, now the main loop is
while the priority queue is not empty

195
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:22,166
we're going to pull off an event. We're
going to test whether it's valid. And

196
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:27,562
that's just checker if anything happened
with those two particles. We're going to

197
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:33,099
pull off the two particles and then we're
going to all, we're going to move all

198
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:39,075
particles by the amount of time that has
elapsed since the last event. And then,

199
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:44,656
we're going to test which of the four
types of events that it is. It's either

200
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:50,174
redraw, bounce, B of A or, or bounce off a
vertical wall or, or a horizontal wall.

201
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,737
And then we'll go ahead and do the
predictions of each of those particles, A

202
00:19:55,737 --> 00:20:01,282
and B, against all other particles. That's
the pretty much all the code for the

203
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:09,427
simulation. So this is data driven code.
So, one thing we can do is just run it for

204
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:16,813
a 100 balls in random position at random
velocity. But what's nice about data

205
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:23,495
driven code is now that the code's working
and again we, we're not saying that this

206
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:31,055
is a trivial code to write but it's
definitely manageable. And it's enabled by

207
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:38,575
priority queues. Without priority queues,
it would be quite a bit more complicated

208
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:45,912
to figure out how to do this. And also, it
wouldn't be reasonably efficient at all

209
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:51,742
for large data sets. So, that's a, a
simple simulation to just generate random

210
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:58,772
positions. People might be interested in
this one. Now this isn't exactly precisely

211
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:04,482
wh at would happen in the real world
mainly because we didn't put in the

212
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:10,836
simulation what happens when three
particles are touching or there's two

213
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:16,683
touching in another one hits them. And
also nobody racks up a, a set of billiard

214
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:23,063
balls such that all fifteen are touching
in all places. So life can be complicating

215
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:28,604
when you try to simulate the natural
world. This is a little bit about

216
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:38,281
Einstein's experiment. If you got one big
particle like a pollen grain and lots of

217
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:46,045
little particles like atoms molecules and
bouncing against it the big one is going

218
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:54,080
to move about randomly. And then this is
another famous physics experiment showing

219
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,053
diffusion. And there's many other things
that you can do with this basic collision

220
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:06,032
system. If you have huge numbers of
particles and you measure the number that

221
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:11,867
hit the size and the frequency with which
they hit they sides you can do experiments

222
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:18,082
relating temperature and pressure and many
other things or do three-dimensional

223
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:23,835
versions. Again simulation of the natural
world is an increasingly important

224
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:33,066
application of computing and need
efficient data structures like priority

225
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:38,056
queues to get it done.
