1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:08,002
So now let's look at a basic geometric
data processing problem of determining

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,538
intersections among a set of line
segments. So, it's called the orthogonal

3
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:18,328
line segment, segment intersection search
where the lines segments or constrained to

4
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:23,585
be either horizontal or vertical. And so,
suppose we have a large number of such

5
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:29,002
line segments and what we want to be able
to do is to find all places where they

6
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:33,934
intersect. And as we'll see this extends
to a practical problem in a number of

7
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:39,245
situations. So, in this case there's four
places where these lines intersect. So,

8
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:44,627
how are we going to be able to determine
these intersections efficiently? Now, the

9
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:50,036
natural algorithm, or the naive
brute-force algorithm, is quadratic in

10
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:56,613
time. So that is, for every line segment,
you check whether it intersects with every

11
00:00:56,613 --> 00:01:03,091
other line segment. And again, as we know,
such an algorithm is not going to be

12
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:10,553
practical, for huge numbers of line
segments. So, just, to simplify our code

13
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:15,821
in the slides in it's off, off from the
case for geometric data processing. We

14
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:21,338
don't have to worry about degeneracies
where lots of things have the same x or y

15
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:27,285
coordinate. And just to simplify the code
and to get it the main principles of the

16
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:33,040
algorithms, we're going to assume that all
the coordinates that we have are distinct

17
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:38,332
that we've preprocessed in some way to
remove the ones that touch without

18
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:44,254
intersecting. So the method that we're
going to look at is a so called Sweep Line

19
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:51,236
algorithm and the idea is to think of
vertical line that sweeps left to right

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:02:00,037
through the data. In to. Consider it as a
every time it hits some line segment as an

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:06,055
event where we have to do something. So
sweeping from left to right means we

22
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:13,395
consider each x coordinate as an event. So
first thing is if we hit a horizontal line

23
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:19,128
segment. Well we're going to hit the left
endpoint first, and so what we'll do when

24
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:25,556
we hit the left, endpoint is, insert, the
y coordinate of that line into a binary

25
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:31,486
search tree. So, we're going to keep track
of y coordinates in a binary search tree.

26
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:36,905
So that's what's happening over in the
right there. So now again, sweep from left

27
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:42,311
to right. What's the next smallest x
coordinate? In this case it's the line

28
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:48,334
number one there, and we'll remember its y
coordinate in a binary search tree. And

29
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:53,788
then two and three. So those that's one
kind of event that can happen as we sweep

30
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:59,018
from left to right. Another kind of event
is that we hit the right endpoint of a

31
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:04,261
horizontal line segment. In this case we
hit the right endpoint of line segment

32
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:10,258
two. So, at that point the right point of
a horizontal line segment we just remove

33
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:15,534
it because we've processed that line
completely. In this case we didn't find

34
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:20,473
any intersections. So, left endpoint
insert the y coordinate into a BST, right

35
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:25,932
endpoint remove that ycoordinate from the
BST. So, the BST contains the y

36
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:32,075
coordinates of all the horizontal lines
that currently might involve an

37
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:38,069
intersection. And then the third kind of
event is what happens when we hit a

38
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:45,000
vertical line segment? Well, in that case
all we want, need to do is just do a range

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,666
search, for the interval of y end points.
So, any point that's inside that interval,

40
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:57,952
is going to represent a horizontal line
segment that is an intersection. That's

41
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:03,550
the basic idea behind the sweep line
algorithm, to find intersections in sets

42
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:10,372
of horizontal and vertical lines. And it's
actually a very simple algorithm, and it's

43
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:17,024
very easy to see that the running time is
going to be proportional to N log N plus

44
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,371
the number of intersections returned.
Where there's N horizontal vertical line

45
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:26,917
segments. And it's, and a couple of ways
to implement it, one thing is you could

46
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:32,328
sort according to the x coordinates, or
you could just put them all on a priority

47
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:39,721
queue. And then, so, so that's going to
take N log N for every one of the lines to

48
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:45,277
process them all either N to build the
priorit y queue and then log N to take the

49
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:50,695
smallest off each time, or N log N for the
sort. And then putting the y coordinates

50
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:56,494
into, into a binary search tree is, again,
N log N. And same for deleting. Each point

51
00:04:56,494 --> 00:05:02,519
has to be inserted, deleted. It could be
as many as N in the tree for each one. So

52
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,486
it's a total of N log N. And then the,
range search, in the binary tree, for

53
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:14,961
each, each one of the range searches. It
might take, log N, it might be as many as

54
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:23,479
N. And then there's, plus the number of
points return. So, That's a, quick sketch

55
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:31,508
of the proof of this proposition. And with
that 1D range search, implementation, we

56
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:38,199
get an efficient N log N, 2D orthogonal,
orthogonal line segment, intersection
