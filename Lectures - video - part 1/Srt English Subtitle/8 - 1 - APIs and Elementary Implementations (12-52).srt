00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:07,034
Welcome back. Today, we're going to look
at Priority Queues which is a variant of

2
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:12,051
sorting that generalizes the idea to
provide more flexible data structure that

3
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:17,069
we can use for all sorts of applications.
To get started, we'll look at the API and

4
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:24,820
some elementary implementations. So at a
week or so ago, we looked at collections

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,813
in Java and the idea of elementary data
structures where we insert and delete

6
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:34,900
items. And then, the data structures
differ on the basis of which item we choose

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,863
to delete. We looked to the push down
stack where we removed the item that was

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:44,776
most recently added, And the queue where we
remove the item that was least recently

9
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:48,643
added. And then, we talked about
randomized queue or bag where we might

10
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:53,580
remove a random or an arbitrary item.
Today, what we're going to talk about is

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,247
called the priority queue and for that, we
insert items, but when it's time to

12
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:03,059
remove, we consider the items to have a
total order and we want to remove the

13
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,044
largest or the smallest item. So this
little example if we insert P, Q, and E

14
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:15,190
then when we do remove max, we want to get
the Q out and for later, we insert X, A,

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,144
and M and then we removed max. The
largest one in there is X. We'll insert P,

16
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:26,069
L, and E and then, after a while, we
remove max P. So, that's our basic setup.

17
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,064
That's our definition of what a priority
queue is. So, the API will look very

18
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:39,719
similar to our stack or queue API with a
difference that we want to have generic

19
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:46,919
items that are comparable. So the Java
language for that is in the class header.

20
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:52,785
We say that our generic type Key extends
Comparable of Key. And that just means

21
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:58,805
that our keys must be Comparable and we
must have a compareTo() method that will

22
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:06,052
compare it to another key. Otherwise we
have a constructor and actually for some

23
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:11,872
applications, it's convenient to have a
constructor that takes an array of keys as

24
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:17,807
argument. Then, an insert() that puts
something in like push in a stack or

25
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:24,142
enqueue in a queue. Then delete the
maximum. I referred to delete the minimum

26
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:30,043
just to avoid confusion, we have the
implementation separate implementation

27
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:36,284
usually MinPQ, where we delete the
minimum. Then test isEmpty() and we also

28
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:42,908
sometimes have extra method that just
gives us the value of the largest key and

29
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:49,602
also size which is useful sometimes in
collections. You might also want it to be

30
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:55,675
iterable but we'll skip that for now.
There are lots and lots of applications of

31
00:02:55,675 --> 00:03:01,039
priority queues. Even though it emerged as
a data structure relatively late in the

32
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,508
game now that we see that there are many
algorithms that are much easier to

33
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:12,314
implement when we think about the priority
key abstraction. We have data that we are

34
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:16,841
processing we can't process it all at once.
We have to save it some of way. And then,

35
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:22,342
what the priority queue tells us is - 
let's organize it in some ways that we are

36
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:27,657
always taking the best one to process
next. And it turns out to be very close to

37
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:32,965
a generic algorithmic design technique
that we will be looking at in many, many

38
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:38,286
different applications. Today, we're going
to talk about event-driven simulation

39
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:44,500
which is an interesting idea that is based
on priority queues but it's also used in

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,126
numerical computation and we'll see in
algorithms for data compression and graph

41
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:56,048
searching that it's useful. And in many
other applications in Computer Science and

42
00:03:56,048 --> 00:04:02,277
in scientific computing. It generalizes the
stack and the queue and gives us a data

43
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:09,783
structure that we can use to effectively
design algorithm of all sorts. So here's

44
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:18,242
just a particular client that will help
explain the idea. So our, our challenge is

45
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:26,215
let's say this is on the web we have
billions of transactions, you know, and they

46
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:32,012
are streaming through our data warehouse
or processor in some way. And just a very,

47
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:37,616
very huge number of transactions. In fact,
we couldn't possibly hope to even store

48
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:43,299
them all. There's trillions of them there
coming through as fast as possible. But

49
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:48,825
we're interested in the biggest ones and
so maybe it's the biggest amount of

50
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:54,559
dollars, or the biggest cost, or whatever
it might happen to be. And so we can pick

51
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:59,581
some numbers that we can store. I would
like to, to store the, the thousand

52
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:04,986
biggest ones. So, you can imagine a credit
card company looking for fraud - it's going

53
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:11,016
to care about keeping track of the largest
transactions. So, maybe we can store

54
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:16,444
millions or thousands of them. So that's
our parameter M - that's the number we can

55
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:21,606
afford to store but the total number of
items we couldn't possibly afford to store

56
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:26,814
them. So and this is just some test data
where we've got all, all these

57
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:32,653
transactions and so we are going to be
able to take in data like this and again

58
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:38,610
an unbounded stream of data. But let's
say, we want to keep track of the top five

59
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:46,723
[cough] values using the third column as
the value. So we're going to look at a

60
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:52,023
client program called TopM that takes the
command-line argument, how many and

61
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:58,026
this case, it's going to say five and then
it's going to take from standard input the

62
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:03,914
transactions and it will print out the top
five. So, that's a canonical example of a,

63
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:09,485
a priority queue client that we need to
design a program that can do that. So,

64
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:17,909
with the priority queue abstraction that's
not too difficult to do. So we are going to

65
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:25,799
use a min-oriented priority queue so
that's going to keep, it'll [cough] it'll

66
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:31,420
be one where we can delete the minimum
and, and it'll be generic so we'll have a

67
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,964
transaction type that holds this
information including natural ordering

68
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:41,475
where it's ordered by dollars that last
column. So, we'll build a new priority

69
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:46,625
queue, min priority queue or we'll have
the capability to delete the minimum. And

70
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:52,449
then we read from standard input. We read
the line, build the transaction from the

71
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:58,920
information on that line. And that will
fill in the fields and then, we put that

72
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,950
transaction on the priority queue. Now, if
the priority queue has more than M items

73
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:11,075
because we inserted that one, then we want
to delete the smallest one there and that

74
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:17,193
way, we're keeping track of the largest M.
Whenever we get a new one, then we

75
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:22,732
throw away the smallest one that's there.
So, even with this huge stream of items

76
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:27,980
coming through, we're only keeping track
of the M largest items and that's a fine

77
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,040
canonical client for priority queue. Now
how we are going implement or solve this

78
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,081
problem or you can think of lots of ways
to go ahead and solve this problem of

79
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:44,088
finding the largest M items in the stream
of N items. So, for example, you could

80
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:51,832
sort them. And then just look at the M at
the end but by sending up the problem, I

81
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:57,801
already kind of ruled that one out because
we don't have the space to sort them all,

82
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:03,280
to store them all. So sorting is out of
the question. We'll look at couple of

83
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,082
elementary priority queue implementations
that are straightforward. You know, keep

84
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:14,309
the items like we would in the stack and
then when we need to find the smallest or

85
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:20,425
the largest look at, look at them all. But
that's going to be too slow. M is large

86
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:26,099
and N is huge, and M<i>N is going to be too
slow. What would what we we'll look at is</i>

87
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,377
very simple and practical implementation
using a data structure called the binary

88
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:36,838
heap that gets the job done in time
proportional to N log M and only M space.

89
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:42,079
And that's pretty close to the best that
we could do in theory and is very

90
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:47,010
important and useful, practical
implementation and data structure.

91
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:56,344
Alright. So here's just an overview of two
elementary implementations for priority

92
00:08:56,344 --> 00:09:03,894
queues using the example operations that I
gave before. So you can imagine keeping

93
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:09,361
the item, say, in a linked list or in
a doubling array and just keeping just an

94
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:14,568
order just as we would in the, in the
stack just keeping in the way that they

95
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:19,593
come in. And we'll put a new item at the
end of the array and remove it from the

96
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:25,566
end of the array. Or you could do it in a linked
list, and then when it's time to find the,

97
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:30,435
remove the maximum, you have to scan
through everything to find the maximum.

98
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:37,014
So, so, that's a one way you could
implement this with, with a linked list or

99
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:42,605
with the resizing array. Or you might to
say well let's try to keep things in

100
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:48,009
order. And then that might involve some
work with the, it's like insertion sort,

101
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:53,429
you find a place to put the new item and
then put it in the right place. And again,

102
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:59,071
you could do this with a linked list or with
the resizing array but then, with array,

103
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:04,568
you'd have to move all the larger ones over
one position to fit the new item in. When

104
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:09,588
we insert E and that's supposed to keep
them in order, we have to move over L, M,

105
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:14,906
P, and P to get the E and then so forth.
But the advantage of that might be that

106
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:20,682
removing the maximum is easy. We just take
away the one at the end. To remove the

107
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:26,650
Q - we know it's at the end to remove
the max. At this point, that's X - it's

108
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,845
right at the end, and P is right at the end.
So you can imagine the implementations of

109
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:38,971
priority queues using these two basic
strategies. Not much code involved. This

110
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:45,098
is a an ordered array implementation of
priority queues and it's quite straight

111
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:52,843
forward. We didn't put in the this is the
cheat version where we require the client

112
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:59,282
to provide a capacity but we could easily
change this to a resizing array. So

113
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:06,243
insert() just puts it at the end, and since
its unordered delete maximum has to go

114
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:12,334
through the entire array to try to find
the maximum when it refines it and the

115
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:18,583
changes that we're the one at the end and
then removes it the same way that we do

116
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:24,536
within the stack. It'll use less and
exchange just like we would in sorting

117
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:30,179
methods. So that's a fine implementation if
the priority queue was going to be tiny

118
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:36,440
all the time. So if you, without even
implementing it, you can understand this

119
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,949
table that if we use an unordered array
implementation we can get insertion done

120
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,940
in constant time but we have
to look at everything to delete the

121
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,343
maximum or even find the maximum. If we
keep it in order, we can find the maximum

122
00:11:54,343 --> 00:12:00,827
or delete it at constant time but it takes us
linear time to insert. And since as

123
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:07,073
with stack and queue operations, these
insert and deletes might be intermixed in

124
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:13,329
arbitrary ways and there might be huge
numbers of them either one of these is

125
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:20,425
very attractive because they're going to
take N times the number of operations.

126
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:28,096
Whereas what we can hope for and what we
actually will achieve is to get log N time

127
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:34,936
for all operations, time proportion to log N
for all operations. With the clever data

128
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:41,677
structure and interesting implementation
we can actually achieve that goal. That's

129
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:47,032
the basic API and some elementary
implementations for priority queues.
