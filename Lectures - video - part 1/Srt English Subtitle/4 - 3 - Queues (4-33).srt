1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:07,708
Okay, next, we'll briefly consider queue
implementations using the same basic

2
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:13,663
underlying data structures. So, here is
the corresponding API for queue of strings.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,964
Actually you know it's the same API for
stacks just the names are different.

4
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:25,926
Instead of push we have enqueue instead of
pop, we have dequeue. And the semantics is

5
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:32,201
different. For enqueue we add an item say
at the end of the queue and for dequeue we

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,301
remove an item from the beginning. It's as
if you're waiting in line to buy a ticket.

7
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:44,758
When you're enqueue you're at the end and
when that's been in there the longest is

8
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:50,892
the one that comes off. So let's look at
how we implement those first using linked list

9
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:56,168
and then arrays. So, now our
representation of a queue with the linked

10
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:02,441
list, we need to maintain two pointers
references. One to the first item in the

11
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:08,328
list and the other to the last item in the
list. When we insert we're going to add

12
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,761
the item at the end of the list instead of
the beginning and when we remove we'll do

13
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:19,704
the same and we'll take it off the front.
So here's the implementation of dequeue.

14
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:27,231
It's identical to the code for pop for a
stack. We save away the item. We delete

15
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:35,403
the first note by advancing the reference
and then we return the item, so identical.

16
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:43,298
To add a node or enqueue, add a new node
to a linked list, we want to put it at the

17
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:50,921
end so that would be the last one return.
So we, to add it at the end so first thing

18
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:58,085
we need to is save a link to the last
node. We're going to need that because we

19
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:06,459
need to change its reference from null to
point to the new node. Then we'll create a

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:14,577
new note for the end of the list will
populate its fields and then that old link

21
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:22,331
will change that from null to a pointer to
the new node. So again just a few lines of

22
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:31,418
code. That's basic linked list processing.
Actually years ago when we taught courses

23
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:37,517
in algorithms and data structures much of
the course would be about this kind of

24
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:44,035
pointer manipulation but nowadays that's
restricted to just a few implementations

25
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:50,580
like stack and queue and a few other
fundamental data structures. So we don't

26
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,139
need so much anymore general programs for
manipulating linked list. We encapsulate

27
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:02,754
them in basic data types like these.
Alright, so let's go back to our full

28
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:09,029
implementation and this is just taking
care of collecting a curve from the

29
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:16,030
previous slides but also taking care of
special cases when the queue is empty to

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,669
make sure that if the queue is empty after
we remove an item, we're going to last at

31
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:29,535
null and make sure that both first and
last always are what we want them to be.

32
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:36,069
So those are details that are easy to
check. Okay, what about arrays? Well, we

33
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,096
want to do the details but it's not
difficult to implement queues with

34
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:47,030
resizing arrays as well and not difficult
but definitely a tricky programming

35
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,761
exercise that people are welcome to try.
So we'll maintain two pointers. The first

36
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:58,411
item in the queue and the tail which is
the position for the next item to appear

37
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:03,087
so for enqueue you add a new item at tail
and for dequeue you remove an item for

38
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:10,554
head. And the trick is that once you get
past the capacity, you have to reset back

39
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:18,058
to zero and so that's a little extra code
and then you have to add the resizing

40
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:25,077
capability as well to implement data
structure the same as for stack. And we'll

41
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:28,013
leave that as an exercise.
