00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:06,044
Next, we're going to look at a bottom-up
version of Mergesort. Well, Mergesort is

2
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:11,006
easy to understand as a recursive program.
This bottom-up version that has no

3
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:16,814
recursion, it's also quite simple to
understand and to code up. The basic idea

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:23,057
is to think of the array as being a little
at the begining a set of little sorted sub

5
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:28,065
arrays of size one. And then what this
method will do is go through and merge

6
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:33,048
those little subarrays of size one
together in pairs to get subarrays of size

7
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:38,038
two. Then, the whole array consists
of sorted subarrays to size two, and

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,059
then we make another pass through to get
size four, and then size eight, and so

9
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:49,036
forth. So, as you can see in this example
we start out by merging the first two sub

10
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:55,360
arrays of size one to make a array of size
two - E, M - that's sorted, and then do the same

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,001
thing for the next two elements and the
next two and so forth until eventually

12
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:06,088
instead of sixteen individual elements we
have eight sorted subarrays of size two.

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,012
Then on another pass through, we can take
the E, M and the G, R and merge them

14
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:17,735
together to make EGMR, and the E, S and the
O, R merge those together to make EORS, and

15
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:22,744
so forth. And we have four subarrays of
size four. One more pass makes two

16
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:29,304
subarrays of size eight, and the last pass
is just a sorted array. The bottom line in

17
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:34,943
this is sequence of passes through the
whole array and there's no recursion

18
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:41,338
needed at all. It's extremely easy to code
up as you can see from this code. We use

19
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:47,442
the same merge code as before and we take
a nested for loop. The first one is the

20
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:53,373
size of the subarray and this loop gets
executed on a log N times because each time

21
00:01:53,373 --> 00:02:00,162
we double the size of the subarray until
we get to N. And then we pass through

22
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:07,553
picking out from low to low+size-1,
and then the next part is low+size+size-1

23
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:13,307
until we run to the end of the array
where we might not have a full

24
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:19,397
subarray of size sz. That is a fully
complete industrial strength code for

25
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:25,756
sorting. The only downsize as would
regular Mergesort is that it uses extra

26
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:31,956
space proportional to the size of the
array. But otherwise, that's a fine method

27
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:39,857
for merging. That's a bottom-up Mergesort.
If you look at this visual trace you can

28
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:45,477
see how it works. The thing is totally
unsorted, then it gets sorted until

29
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:49,712
subarrays to size four, then eight,
sixteen, and 32. Now in this case the

30
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:55,320
second subarray to be sorted is smaller
but the merge routine doesn't really care

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,225
about that so much. You can merge things
that are not equal in size. And then we get

32
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:07,106
a final sorted array. Whatever the size,
bottom of Mergesort gets the job done in

33
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:13,833
log N passes. Each pass using about N
compares for a total cost of about N log N.
