1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:07,024
Finally, we talk about stability. This is
really one of the rules of the game but

2
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:11,029
it's much easier to talk about in the
context of the real algorithms that we've

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:15,068
seen so far. And really it doesn't make
sense if you don't know about comparators

4
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:21,022
which we just introduced. So, the typical
application that I just used as an example

5
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:26,098
is say the set of student records. So we
have them sorted by name and this is say,

6
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:31,884
something that we do just before assigning
final grades. Maybe the third line there

7
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:38,026
is the final grade. So it's all fine
sorted by name and but then in order to

8
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:44,009
distribute it out to the people leading it
to the sections, what we want to do is

9
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:50,625
sort by the second fields, sort by
section. The problem is that when we do

10
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:57,945
that, it messes up the sort by name and
that's annoying. You might assume that

11
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:04,329
once you have it sorted by name, then when
you sorted by the second field then it

12
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:10,742
should maintain the sort of by name for
all that have equal keys in that second

13
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:17,191
field. Actually not all sorts preserve
that property that is called stability.

14
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:22,726
And clearly, it's worthwhile to think
about for your application whether you

15
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:28,039
want or need a stable sort. And so, it's
an annoying surprise for many people and

16
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:33,659
many applications. So a stable sort is a
sort that preserves the relative order of

17
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,956
items with equal keys. Whichever sort are
stable? That's an interesting question

18
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:44,879
that we'll take a look at now. The quick
bottom line is that insertion sort and

19
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:52,238
mergesort are stable but not selection
sort or Shellsort. And even within that

20
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:58,477
bottom line, there's implementations that
maybe are not stable. You have to

21
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:04,158
carefully check the code to be sure.
Always, in this class, we have an exercise

22
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:10,834
or exam question is this version of this
sort stable or not? So, students learn to

23
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:16,709
recognize whether the code is stable. So
this is just another typical example where

24
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:21,879
we've got things sorted by time, and then
what we want to do is maybe these are

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,435
important events. People buying tickets to
a rock concert and I'm going to sort by

26
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:31,702
location what we'd hope is that it would
keep the sort by time but this is a

27
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:36,640
non-stable sort that doesn't do bad so
then out in the location they're going to

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,725
have to resort it if they use one of
these. But if they use a stable sort, then

29
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:47,692
it stay sorted by time and lots of
applications you want stability. Alright,

30
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:54,015
so let's just look at each of the
algorithms that we've considered so far.

31
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:59,097
Insertion Sort. Insertion Sort is stable.
Why is it stable? Well, we never move

32
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:05,633
equal items pass one another. In this
example here, when we get A1, well that's

33
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:12,141
so in this case, the index is just one
that appears in the array, it's just A's

34
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:18,763
and B's. When we get our second A, we stop
the sort as long as we're not less. We're

35
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:24,911
equal, we're not less, we stop it so we
never move an equal item pass another one.

36
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:30,488
If this less or less than or equal, then
it wouldn't work. Or if we did the other

37
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:35,818
way around and proceeded accordingly. So,
equal items never move past each other in

38
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,997
this code so therefore insertion sort is
stable. But selection sort is not stable.

39
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:49,529
Usually way, the way to show that a sort
is not stable and it's just to see if it

40
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:55,875
has a long distance exchange that might
move an item pass some equal item. So,

41
00:03:56,163 --> 00:04:02,245
[cough] in this case, for example, for
selection sort, when we do that first

42
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:08,471
exchange oops, [cough] where we found the
minimum A and B is in position zero. We

43
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:14,951
did a long distance exchange and that
catapulted that first item past any item

44
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:21,249
that it might be equal putting them out of
order. And that's may not get fixed so

45
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:26,524
that sort is not stable. It might move
items past some equal item and leave a

46
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:32,601
result where items that are equal or in
different order than they were originally

47
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:39,016
in the file. Selection Sort is not stable.
Shellsort also has long distance exchange

48
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:45,479
and so it's not stable. It moves keys past
other keys that could be equal and so its

49
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,024
easy to construct examples showing that
Selection Sort is not stable. And what

50
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:57,527
about Mergesort? Mergesort is stable well,
it's stable as long as the merge operation

51
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:02,923
is stable and that operation is going to
be stable depending on how we code it.

52
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:09,232
And, and in our code, if the two keys are
equal, it takes from the left subarray so

53
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:15,670
that means that, it will always take the,
if there's a two sets of equal keys, it

54
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,112
will preserve the relative order and
that's enough to show that the merge

55
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:26,672
operation is stable and then therefore
Mergesort is stable. Stability is an

56
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:38,905
important property in sorting algorithms.
Mergesort is not only efficient, it's also
