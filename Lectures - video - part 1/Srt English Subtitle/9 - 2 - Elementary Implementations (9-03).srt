1
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:06,041
Next, we'll look at some elementary symbol
table implementations. These are so simple

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:10,084
that we won't go into much detail. But
still, it's worthwhile to take a look at

3
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:15,009
them to set the stage for the more
advanced implementations we'll consider

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:21,041
next. Well, one thing we could do is
maintain a link list. We could keep it in

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:25,906
order or keep it unordered, this version
keeps it unordered. So, we are going to

6
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:32,034
have nodes in the link list, that have key
value pairs, they have every key in the

7
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:36,742
symbol table and a value associated to
that key. For search, we have to, since

8
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:42,539
it's unordered, scan through the whole
list to find a match, a key that's there.

9
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:48,291
For insert, I would also have to scan
through all keys to find the place to

10
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:54,050
update a value, if it's a value that's
already there. And if there's no match,

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,797
then we could add it to the front. So
here's our simple client for traces. So if

12
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:07,044
we associate S with zero, we just had it
that's our one node link, link list that's

13
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:13,594
got that information. Associate E with one
that's not there, so we just add it to the

14
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:19,465
beginning of the list. A with two, R with
three, C with four, H with five, and so

15
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:24,716
forth. So now, when we associate E with
six, we have to search through the list to

16
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:31,022
see if there's an E. In this case there
is, and then we update, just update that

17
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:36,046
value. That's the associative array
abstraction. It's possible to implement

18
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:41,076
symbol tables that allow multiple values
with the same key and so forth. And that

19
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:46,082
leads to different types of clients,
different types of implementations. We're

20
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:51,081
going to stick to this associative array
abstraction and no duplicate keys in the

21
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:56,086
symbol table because it both simplifies
implementations and leads to simpler

22
00:01:56,086 --> 00:02:06,062
client code. Okay, X7 is a new value A8 we
found A in there and update the value

23
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:14,050
eight and then M9, P10, L11 are all out
there, and they go at the beginning, and

24
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,816
then the last one changes the value at E
again, twelve. So, this is a, a simple

25
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:29,260
implementing this as a example of link
list processing. Slight modification of

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,529
our stack and queue code. And we will skip
the details and just a note that what's

27
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:43,546
the cost of implementing this. Well if
there's been if there are N things on the

28
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:49,664
symbol table, you have to, for both search
and insert look all the way through. And

29
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:55,896
if everything's random then on average,
you only have to look halfway through for

30
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:02,087
a successful search. And well, you still
have to insert another issue is for many

31
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:09,013
clients if the keys are ordered it's nice
to be able to iterate through the symbol

32
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:15,040
table in order and this one by definition
doesn't provide that. And this one just

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,037
uses equals. So, the keys don't have to be
comparable for this it just uses equals.

34
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:27,759
So our challenge is to look for methods
that give us more efficient

35
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,607
implementations than search and insert
searching operations. And we've already

36
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:39,711
looked at an algorithm that can do this
and that's binary search. So for binary

37
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:47,821
search the now, what we're going to do is
use an ordered array. And actually use

38
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:54,044
parallel arrays, one for the keys and one
for the values. And the idea is to keep

39
00:03:54,044 --> 00:04:00,005
the array of keys in sorted order. And
then find the index associated with the

40
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:05,882
key that we're searching for using binary
search and then use that index to get the

41
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:11,184
value that's associated with that key
that's stored in the parallel array. And

42
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:16,630
we looked at the binary search algorithm
earlier in the course. And so, for

43
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,881
example, if we're doing a, if these are
the keys in our symbol table. And we're

44
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:29,715
doing a search for the index where P is
stored. We look at the middle. P is bigger

45
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:35,120
than L, so we look to the right. Look in
the middle of the right half. P is less

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,359
than R so we look to the left. Continue
until we find P. When we find P, we return

47
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:48,588
its index, and we use that index to get us
the value that we need or another way to

48
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:54,613
look at this is that implements the
function, how many keys are there that are

49
00:04:54,613 --> 00:05:00,598
less than K. So, for example, for queue
that's unsuccessful search and you can

50
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:06,760
figure out from the last index when you
don't find your the element that you're

51
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,557
seeking you can figure out the return
value, which is the number of keys that

52
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:17,731
are less than it. So, that's a trace of
implementing binary search to find the

53
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:22,390
rank of a key in an ordered array, and
again, for successful, you can use that

54
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,129
rank to return the value and for if it is
unsuccessful, you can use that rank to

55
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:36,904
figure out where to insert the new key.
Alright. So, this is the code for the get

56
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:44,725
operation in this rank, which is binary
search. So this is precisely the binary

57
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:52,346
search curve that we looked at before. So,
let's look at again. So if the whole table

58
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:59,018
is empty, return null. Otherwise, we call
rank and that could gives us the number of

59
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:05,565
keys less than the current key. And so,
that is where we look to check to see if

60
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:12,551
that key is there. If it's there, then we
return the value with the same index in

61
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:19,175
the parallel array. If it's not there,
then we return null, saying the key's not

62
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:26,409
there. Now, the problem with minor
searches well, not necessarily a problem

63
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:32,719
but the situation is that if when it's
time to insert a new element, we have to

64
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:38,699
move everything larger over one position
just like an insertion sort. So, if the

65
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:44,072
table has A, E, R, and S and we have to
insert the value C, then we have to move

66
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:49,889
the E, R, and S over one position to put
the C and then put the value associated

67
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,381
with C if they're the same thing in the
values array. Move all the values

68
00:06:55,381 --> 00:07:00,560
associated with those keys over one
position and put the associated value in.

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,351
So, this is a trace of what would happen
for our trace. And, and again, every

70
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:11,072
insertion involves, involves making a new
position by moving all the larger keys

71
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:18,541
over one position do the same thing in the
values array. And if it's changing the

72
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:25,094
value associated with a key that's already
there, then it's just a matter of finding

73
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:32,999
where the key is and changing the value at
that index. So, those from that trace is

74
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:39,248
pretty easy to see what's involve, what's
involved for the code and we'll skip that

75
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:44,231
code. And just take a look at the
comparison between this elementary

76
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:49,534
implementation for symbol tables with the
sequential search in an unordered list.

77
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:55,380
So, one thing is we're using a different
key interface. We're taking advantage of

78
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,332
the fact that the keys are comparable to
give us an efficient search. Ah., we can

79
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:06,331
do search in worst case in average case,
in time proportional to log N. That's what

80
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:11,810
binary search provides for us. And this is
a fine data structure for symbol tables

81
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,740
where there's where, that are relatively
static, where the values don't change

82
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,236
much, and most of the operations are
search. It's hard to beat binary search.

83
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:28,649
On the other hand, in a dynamic situation
where there are a lot of inserts. This

84
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,457
method is going to be problematic because
the cost of its insert is linear and

85
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:39,208
proportional to N/2. If you have a huge
number of operations and everyone who is

86
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:44,864
proportional to the symbol table size,
then you're just not going to be able to

87
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:50,742
support huge numbers of keys. What we want
is efficient implementations of both

88
00:08:50,742 --> 00:09:02,557
search and insert. Those are elementary
implementations. Next we'll look at more

89
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:05,028
advanced ones.
