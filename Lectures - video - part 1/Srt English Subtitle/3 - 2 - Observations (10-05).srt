1
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:15,063
Okay, so the first step is to be able to
make some observations about the running

2
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:22,004
time of the programs. And for analysis of
algorithms that's easier than in a lot of

3
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:27,096
scientific disciplines, as we'll see. For
a running example we're going to use the

4
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:34,016
so-called 3-sum problem. And it's an easy
to state problem. If you've got N distinct

5
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:40,254
integers, how many triple sum to exactly
zero? For example in this file 8ints.text.

6
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:48,096
Text which has eight integers in it.
There's four triples that sum to zero. 30

7
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:56,832
- 40, ten. 30 - twenty - ten and so forth
and so our goal is to write a program that

8
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:03,554
can compute this quantity for any input
file, any set of N integers. This is

9
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:09,796
actually a, an extremely important
computation that's deeply related to many

10
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:16,446
problems in computational geometry which
is a branch of computer science that

11
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:24,536
covers the algorithms and underlying
science related to graphics and movies and

12
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:32,040
geometric models of all sort. So this is a
actually an important practical problem.

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,459
But it's a simple one to write code for in
a view you could write down this program

14
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,583
without much effort. It's a, got a static
method count that is going to go ahead and

15
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:56,317
take a integer array as an argument. And,
is that, that's a number of integers,

16
00:01:56,317 --> 00:02:02,660
that's the length of the array. We will
start with a variable count equals zero,

17
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,363
and then a triple for loop, that checks
each triple I j k, we go I from one and j

18
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:15,181
from I+1 to n, and k from j+1 to n, so
that we get each triple just once. And

19
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,818
then if I+j, ai + aj + ak = zero, we
increment the count. Alright. And after

20
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:25,093
that triple four loop, we return the
count. And then the main method, in this

21
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:30,769
simple class just reads in, all the
integers, and prints out the count. So

22
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,696
that's a brute force algorithm that is a
fine method for solving the three sum

23
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:41,615
problem, now what we're interested in is
how much time does this take as a function

24
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:47,808
of' n? Well, one to time our program is to
is just look at the watch. If you have a

25
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:54,925
stopwatch, or look at the clock or your
phone, or whatever you might need you can

26
00:02:54,925 --> 00:03:02,164
just go ahead and time it if you want or
we have, Java has this part of it's

27
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:09,024
standard library, a stopwatch class that
will go ahead and compute a lapse time.

28
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:15,968
So, in order, anytime you run a program,
if it is setup to easily take input of

29
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:23,990
different sizes, a natural thing to do, is
just run it for bigger sizes. So for eight

30
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:32,381
ints this program takes not too much time,
for 1000 ints it takes half a second. For

31
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:42,303
2,000. Takes more time. That's 3.7 seconds
run it again, still takes 3.7 seconds for

32
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:50,231
4,000, so each time we're doubling the
size of the input and it's definitely

33
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:58,930
taking more time each time. And actually
as we'll see if programmers who get in the

34
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,490
habit of testing or any time on their
program in this way can get so that you

35
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:13,038
can actually pretty easily and quickly
evaluate when it's going to finish. In

36
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:20,010
fact. While you're waiting for it to
finish you can often figure it out. So

37
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:27,000
that one took 30 seconds for 4K and
definitely we could figure it out how long

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,047
it's going to take for 8K before it
finishes, and you'll see how in just a

39
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:40,037
second. I'm not going to wait right now.
You can think about what you think. Okay

40
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:45,203
so [cough] that's empirical analysis,
analysis. Run it for various input sizes

41
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:51,869
and measure their running time. Now if
this were some scientific problem where we

42
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:57,320
were counting something that happen in the
natural world. The number of ants in an

43
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,255
ant hill or whatever then we'd have only a
few data points and we would try to

44
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:08,837
understand whats was going on by doing a
plot of or running time with quite

45
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:15,240
interested in on the Y axis and problem
size with the X axis. Hit a curve like

46
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,767
this and actually whats science usually do
because of some many problems fall into

47
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:29,001
out of this class is do the plot as a lg,
lg plot. If you do it as a lg, lg plot

48
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:36,320
very often you'll get a straight line. And
the slope of the straight line is the key

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,582
to what's going on. In this case, the
slope of the straight line is three and so

50
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:49,272
you can run what's called a regression to
fit a late, the straight line through the

51
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:55,078
data points. And then, it's not difficult
to show to do the math to show that if you

52
00:05:55,078 --> 00:06:01,409
get a straight line and the slope is B,
then your function is proportional to A,

53
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,799
N^B. That's called the power law. And
that's true of many, many scientific

54
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:13,633
problems including most algorithms. So
here's a little bit of the math for that.

55
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:22,794
So the straight line means that since we
did a lg, lg plot with powers of two, that

56
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:29,850
lg(T(N) = B lg N + C. And we have our
empirical values of B and C and then if

57
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,950
you raise both sides of that equation to
two to that power then you get T(N) = a

58
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,422
constant times N^B. So right away just
from observation we have a pretty good

59
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:50,512
model for the running time for our
program, we can figure and do the math and

60
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:59,028
figure out that it seems as though the
running time is about ten^-10 N^3 seconds.

61
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:05,053
We can use that hypothesis to go ahead and
make predictions. Just plug in for

62
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:11,067
different values of N and it says it will
take us 400 seconds for 16,000. 400

63
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:16,059
seconds is plenty of time but now we can
go ahead and invest and run that

64
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:22,611
experiment and sure enough we're pretty
close to that 408 seconds when we run it.

65
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,109
And now we can make a prediction for
32,000 or for or for whatever else we

66
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:32,219
might be interested in. The model helps us
do predictions without investing the

67
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:38,927
expense to run the experiments. In fact,
in this situation if there is a power law,

68
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:45,689
and again in a very great majority of
computer algorithm running times is going

69
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:51,812
to be a power law. What we can do is just
double the size of the input each time the

70
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:58,009
way we were and take the ratio of the
running times for N and 2N. And if you do

71
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:04,713
that, that ratio going to converge to a
constant. And in fact the log of the ratio

72
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:10,258
is going to converge to that constant,
which is the exponent of N and the running

73
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:16,342
time. And you just need a little math to
check that one, but that's a very easy and

74
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:21,460
natural way to go ahead and predict
running times. So that's what I said

75
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,756
before is, so we have this quick way to
estimate B in the power law relationsh ip.

76
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:33,342
How do we estimate A? Well we can just run
it and solve for A. So once we've decided

77
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:41,138
that, that exponent is three let's run it
for some big N and we get pretty close

78
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:48,197
model to the one we had from plotting
things. So it's almost identical

79
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:56,197
hypothesis and we just got it by running
the program double N each time. Okay so

80
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:04,905
there is a lot of effects in trying to
understand the running time of a program

81
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:10,182
on, on your machine. [cough] So. Key
effects are independent of what computer

82
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:15,004
it is. And that's the algorithm you're
using and what's the data. And that's

83
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:20,269
going to really determine the exponent in
the power law. And then there's a lot of,

84
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,632
system dependent effects. What kind of
hardware do you have? Do you have a fast

85
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:30,056
computer or a slow one? What kind of
software? What's going on in your

86
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:35,095
computer? All of those things really
determine the constant A in the power law.

87
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:40,894
So. In modern systems it is so much going
on in the hardware and software, it's

88
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:46,288
sometimes difficult to get really precise
measurements. But on the other hand we

89
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:52,050
don't have to sacrifice animals, or fly to
another planet the way they do in other

90
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,304
sciences, we can just run a huge number of
experiments and usually take care of

91
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,032
understanding these kind of effects.
