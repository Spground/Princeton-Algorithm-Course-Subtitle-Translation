1
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,096
Welcome back.
Today we're going to look at Quicksort.

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:09,734
It was named as one of the most important
algorithms of the twentieth century and

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:14,040
it's widely used for system sorts and many
other applications.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,079
Last lecture, we looked at Mergesort,
another classic sorting algorithm, that's

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,492
used in many systems, and today we are
looking at Quicksort which is used in many

6
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,030
others.
You can even get a Quicksort t-shirt

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,061
nowadays.
So what is the Quicksort method?

8
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:36,375
It's also a recursive method, but the
basic idea behind Quicksort is that it

9
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:42,029
does the recursion after it does the work,
whereas Mergesort did it before it did the

10
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:45,044
work.
So, the idea is first randomly shuffle the

11
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:48,073
array.
That's an important step that we'll talk

12
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:54,010
about later, and then partition the array,
so that's to divide it so that for sum

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,046
value j the entry a of j is in place in
the array.

14
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:02,084
There's no larger entry to the left of j
and no smaller entry to the right of j.

15
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:06,682
Once we have the array partitioned in that
way, shown here in the middle.

16
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:11,184
Right here, we have K in its position.
And we have everybody to the left.

17
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:15,732
There's nobody greater than K.
And everybody to the right, there's nobody

18
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:18,818
less.
Once we have it arranged in that way, then

19
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:23,488
we recursively sort the two parts.
Sort the left part, sort the right part.

20
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:27,624
And then after those two things are done,
the whole thing is sorted.

21
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:32,793
This method was invented in 1961 by Tony
Hore, who won the Turing Award in 1980 for

22
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:37,783
this and other work.
So let's look at a demo of how Quicksort

23
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:41,570
partitioning works.
The idea is to arbitrarily choose the

24
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,372
first element to be the partitioning
element.

25
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:48,261
Since we shuffled the array, that's our
random element from the array.

26
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:53,502
And then we're going to maintain an I
pointer that moves from left to right, and

27
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:58,478
a J pointer that moves from right to left.
Let's look how it works in the demo.

28
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,887
So we start again by picking K as the
partitioning element.

29
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:08,022
And then our method is to move the I
pointer from left to right.

30
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:12,350
As long as what we have is less than the
partitioning element.

31
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,542
And move the j pointer from right to left
as long as it points to an item that's

32
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:21,999
greater than the partitioning element.
So, in this example the i pointer stops

33
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:26,569
right away because it's pointing to an r
which is bigger than the partitioning

34
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,088
element.
The j pointer decrements until it gets to

35
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:34,680
the c which it stops there which is less
than the partitioning element.

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,140
And so now what's going to happen is those
two elements are out of place.

37
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,804
The partitioning elements in between them
and they're in the wrong order.

38
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:47,057
So what we want to do is exchange those.
And then move on.

39
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:51,516
Now we increment I, as long as it's
pointing to an element that's less than

40
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,881
the partitioning element.
Stop here at t cuz that's bigger.

41
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:59,530
And now we decrement j, as long as it's
pointing to something that's bigger than

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,934
the partitioning element.
Stop her at I because that's less.

43
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:07,419
Again, t and I are in the wrong places.
If we exchange them, we'll maintain the

44
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,514
invariant that everything to the left of I
is less than the partitioning element, or

45
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:17,232
nothing to the left of I is greater than
the partitioning element, and nothing to

46
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:20,406
the right of j is less than the
partitioning element.

47
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:23,376
So exchange increment I as long as it's
less.

48
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:27,504
Stop at l increment j decrement j as long
as it's greater.

49
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:32,779
Stop at e those two elements are out of
position so exchange them.

50
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:38,408
Now increment i, stop at the l which is
greater than k decrement j stop at the e

51
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:44,804
which is less than k and now at this point
the partitioning process is complete,

52
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:50,618
coomplete cause the pointers have crossed
and we have looked at everything in the

53
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:51,828
array.
In fact.

54
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:58,654
J points to the, rightmost element in the
left subfiles, everything that's not

55
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:02,531
greater than K.
So we can just exchange J with our

56
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,488
partitioning element.
And now we've achieved the goal of

57
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:10,740
partitioning the array.
So that A of J is in its position.

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,254
Nobody to the left is greater.
Nobody to the right is less.

59
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:22,380
Now, the code for partitioning is straight
forward to implement.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,965
Down below.
Shows the state of the array before

61
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:29,758
partitioning.
During and after partitioning.

62
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:34,777
So in the end, the J pointer is pointing
to the partitioning element V, which was

63
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:39,002
in position V in the first place.
In the, all during the partitioning

64
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,836
process, the code is maintaining this
invariant.

65
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,982
Where everything to the left of I is less
than or equal to V.

66
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:49,096
Everything to the right of J is greater
than or equal to V.

67
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,576
And we haven't looked at things in
between.

68
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:55,896
So, finding, incrementing I, as long as
it's less is a simple while loop.

69
00:04:55,896 --> 00:05:00,781
And then we put a test to make sure we
don't run off the right end of the array.

70
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:03,927
And decrementing J.
As long as it's pointing to a bigger

71
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:08,743
element that's similarly just a wide loop
we put in to test to make sure we don't

72
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:12,831
run off the left end of the array.
Then there's a test to see if the pointers

73
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,644
cross.
Swap the elements of I and j.

74
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:20,014
When we get to the pointers cross we break
out of the loop and exchange the

75
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:26,038
partitioning element into position.
So that's a quick implementation of the

76
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,751
Quicksort partitioning method.
Now, Quicksort itself then is going to be

77
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:35,478
a recursive program that uses that
partitioning method.

78
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,324
First thing we do is the public sort
method that takes the array of comparable

79
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,661
items as its argument.
It's gonna to do a shuffle.

80
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:49,933
And that shuffle is needed to make sure
that we can guarantee that the performance

81
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,486
is gonna be good.
And then it calls the recursive method

82
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:58,481
that takes as arguments the limits of the
subarray that's gonna be sorted.

83
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,879
So then partitioning.
Simply does the partitioning.

84
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,937
Tells us where, which element is in
position, and then recursively sorts the

85
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:11,762
last part that's loaded, J -one.
And then the right part, that's J + one to

86
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,178
high.
That's a complete implementation of

87
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:19,231
Quicksort.
Again, as with Mergesort, studying a

88
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:25,241
recursive trace is instructive.
And this one is kind of upside down as

89
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:29,879
compared to Mergesort.
The first line shows the partitioning

90
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,992
where k is put into position.
Then the method calls the sort for the

91
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:41,132
left subfile first, and then that's gonna
be partitioned on this e, and so forth.

92
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:46,874
And eventually we get down to small
subfiles, actually our code doesn't do

93
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:53,085
anything at all for subarrays of size one,
so we just leave those in gray, and then

94
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:58,842
it does the right subfile, and so forth.
Again, studying this, a, a trace like

95
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:05,961
this, gives a, a good feeling for exactly
what's going on in the recursive program.

96
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:11,003
Let's look at an animation of Quicksort in
operation.

97
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:14,922
There's the partition.
Now it's working on the left.

98
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:19,654
Now it's partitioning the right.
Now it's working on the left part of the

99
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:22,251
right.
Now it's partitioning what's left.

100
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:26,435
Doing the left part of that.
And working from left to right, by

101
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:29,582
dividing each sub-array in half as it
goes.

102
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,764
So let's look.
Consider some of the details in

103
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,384
implementation of partitioning with quick
sort.

104
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:38,086
So first thing is the partition is in
place.

105
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:44,021
You could use an extra array and the
partitioning code would be a little bit

106
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,029
easier.
But one of the big advantages of Quicksort

107
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,031
over Mergesort is that it doesn't take any
extra space.

108
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:56,034
It gets the sort done in place.
Now you have to be a little bit careful

109
00:07:56,034 --> 00:08:00,051
with terminating the loop.
When we give you working code it's not

110
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:04,087
hard to see why it works.
And you might go trough the exercise of

111
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:10,001
trying to implement Quicksort without
looking at our code, and you'll find that

112
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:15,001
testing when the pointers cross can be a
little bit tricky, particulary in the

113
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,075
presence of duplicate keys.
Also staying in bounds.

114
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:24,729
And I, actually, in our implementation the
test of the J pointer running off the left

115
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,338
end is redundant.
Why is it redundant?

116
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:31,977
Well, the partitioning element is sitting
there and it'll stop when it hits the

117
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:35,153
partitioning element.
But the other test is not in our

118
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:40,039
implementation.
And the key thing, one key thing is that

119
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,368
the way that these implementations work.
If the in-, the file is, the array is

120
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:50,591
randomly ordered, then the two sub-arrays
after partitioning will also be randomly

121
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:54,582
ordered.
Actually, some implementations of Quick

122
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:59,391
Sort out in the wild don't have this
property, and they suffer a little bit in

123
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,584
performance.
That random shuffle at the beginning is

124
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,700
important and needed for guaranteeing
performance.

125
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,071
And the other thing I have referred to but
not talked about in detail is the presence

126
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:15,531
of equal keys.
You might think it would be better to

127
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:19,886
handle equal keys in some special way.
We'll talk about that in a second.

128
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:24,819
But this general purpose implementation
stops the pointers on keys equal to the

129
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:30,098
partitioning items key and we'll take a
look at why that's important in a minute.

130
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:36,016
So now let's look at the running time
estimates about why we care about

131
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:40,073
Quicksort vs Mergesort.
This is extending the table we looked at

132
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:46,033
last time, and you can see over in the
right column here, Quicksort is quite a

133
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:51,087
bit faster than Mergesort.
And again, a good algorithm is much better

134
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:58,073
than having a super computer.
Even on your PC you can sort huge array of

135
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:05,026
a million items in less then a second and
a million items in only a few minutes.

136
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:11,071
So again this time, sort of timing is why
Quicksort is so widely used.

137
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,030
Cuz it's simply just faster than
Mergesort.

138
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:21,098
Well in the best case Quick Sort will
divide everything exactly in half.

139
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:27,037
And that makes it kind of like Merge Sort.
It's about analog in.

140
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:33,027
And in the worst case if the random
shuffle winds up putting the items exactly

141
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:38,071
in order, then partitioning doesn't,
doesn't really do anything except find the

142
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:44,002
smallest, peel off the smallest item.
Kind of discover that everything to the

143
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,057
right is greater.
That's a bad case.

144
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:50,074
But if we shuffled randomly, it's
extremely unlikely to happen.

145
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:57,007
Most interesting thing about the study of
Quicksort is the average case analysis.

146
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:03,018
This is a somewhat detailed mathematical
derivation, but it is worthwhile going

147
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:08,762
through the steps, to really get a feeling
for why it is that, Quicksort is quick.

148
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:14,804
So what we do is, as we did for Merge
Sort, is write down a mathematical

149
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:19,819
recurrence relation that corresponds to
what the program does.

150
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:26,283
In the case of Quick Sort, the number of
comparisons taken to sort N items is N+1

151
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:31,243
for the partitioning.
Plus what happens next depends on what the

152
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:36,024
partitioning element was.
If the partitioning element is K.

153
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:41,843
Any particular value happens with
probability one over n, and if it's k,

154
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:47,694
then the left subfile has k - one items in
it, and the right subfile has n - k items

155
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:52,040
in it.
So, for every value of k, if you add those

156
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,900
up the probability that the partitioning
element is k, plus the cost for the two

157
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,997
subfiles, we get this equation.
This looks like a fairly daunting

158
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:07,310
equation, but actually it's not too
difficult to solve.

159
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,941
First thing we do is just multiply by N
and collect terms.

160
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:16,694
So NCN N times N + one.
And then these terms, every size appears

161
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,701
twice.
So it's twice the sum of from C0 to CN -

162
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,670
one.
It's a simpler equation already.

163
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:30,245
Now what we can do is get rid of that sum
by subtracting the same equation for N

164
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:37,079
minus one.
So NCN - N - one, CN - one then the N, N +

165
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,088
one - N - one N is just 2N.
And then the sum collapses just leaving

166
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:48,391
the last term.
This sum, minus the same sum for N - one,

167
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:54,079
just leaves the 2CN - one.
Now that's looking like a much simpler

168
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,509
equation.
Rearrange the terms, so we get n+1 cn-1

169
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:04,069
and then divided by n, n+1.
That's a kind of a magic step, but we will

170
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:10,009
see that it makes possible to solve the
equation easily.

171
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:16,042
Because that equation, with C over N plus
one equals CN minus one over N, is an

172
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:20,058
equation that telescopes the first term at
the right.

173
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:25,069
It's the same as the term on the left.
So we can apply the same equation so its

174
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:29,413
two over n + one.
We apply for n - one we get one less here

175
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:34,473
and we can throw out a lot two over n.
And continue that way throwing out two

176
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:39,376
over decreasing numbers all the way down
until we get down to two elements, c1

177
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:43,104
which is zero.
Substitute the previous equation

178
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:47,537
telescope.
And then that gives us an easy sum that we

179
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:52,716
can approximate by an integral.
It's one over X from three to N+1.

180
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:57,110
And that's a pretty close approximation,
in this case.

181
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,683
And that approximation gives us, it's
about two M+1 natural log N comparisons

182
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:06,297
for Quicksort.
About 1.39 N log N.

183
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:11,995
That's the average number of comparisons
taken by Quicksort, and actually they for

184
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:17,169
a random permutation of the elements which
is what we do with the shuffle.

185
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:22,330
They the expected number of comparisons is
concentrated around this value.

186
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,489
It's very likely to be very near this
value is then as large.

187
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:31,633
So the worst case quick sort is quadratic.
So complexity's going to tell us that it's

188
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:35,090
a quadratic algorithm if that's what its
worst case is.

189
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:40,272
But with random, the random shuffle it's
more likely that this lecture will end,

190
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:44,158
because of a lightning strike.
Or your computer will be struck by a

191
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,624
lightning bolt.
So we can discount that.

192
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:51,307
The average case, which is extremely
likely for any practical application, is

193
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,733
going to be about 1.39 n log n.
So that's more compares than Mergesort

194
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,643
uses.
But Quicksort is much faster, because it

195
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,724
doesn't do much corresponding to each
compare.

196
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:05,509
It just does the compare and increment a
pointer.

197
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,832
Whereas, Mergesort has to move the items
into and out of the auxiliary array, which

198
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:14,520
is more expensive.
So the random shuffle is a key for good

199
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,560
performance in Quicksort.
It gives us the guarantee that the worst

200
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,584
case is not gonna happen.
And also, it allows us to develop a math

201
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:26,726
model that we can go ahead and validate
with experimentation.

202
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:32,345
You run Quick Sort and you count compares.
If you did the random shuffle, it'll be

203
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:36,725
about 1.39 n log n compares.
And its running time will be proportional

204
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:41,311
to n log n, and it'll be a fast sort.
And that's what people do, and that's why

205
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,143
people use it.
Now there are some things that you have to

206
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:51,274
watch out for with Quicksort because the
implementation is a bit fragile and it's

207
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:55,582
easy to make mistakes.
And you'll find textbook implementations

208
00:15:55,582 --> 00:16:00,717
or implementations out on the web that
wind up running in quadratic time in

209
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,964
certain situations.
You have to be a little bit careful of

210
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,856
that and even if everything is randomized
if there's lots of duplicates and the

211
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:17,035
implementation is not done quite right the
quick sort might take quadratic time.

212
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:21,286
So, let's summarize the properties of
Quicksort.

213
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:25,915
It's in place.
It doesn't use any extra space.

214
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,498
The depth of recursion.
So tha, that's.

215
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:36,007
Again, dependent on the random shuffling,
is going to be logarithmic.

216
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:41,700
You can, limit the depth of recursion by
always doing the smaller sub-array before

217
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,517
the larger sub-array.
But that's not really necessary nowadays,

218
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:51,229
as long as you've done the, random shuffle
Oh, and by the way, Quicksort is not

219
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:58,530
stable cuz partitioning does one of those
long range exchanges that might put a, a

220
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:04,073
key with equal value over a key another
key with the same value.

221
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:10,542
So it's a little more work to make
Quicksort stable, maybe using extra space.

222
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:16,567
Un, so what about in actually in practice?
This is our fastest sorting algorithm, and

223
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:21,623
there's a few ways to make it even faster.
And these, we looked at some similar

224
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:26,919
things with for the Word, Mergesort.
And it's definitely worthwhile taking

225
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,650
implementing for a Quicksort.
First thing is small sub-arrays.

226
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,607
Even Quicksort has more overhead than you
want for a tiny array, like one of size

227
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:41,106
two or three or four.
So can implement it to cut off to

228
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:46,340
insertion sort for small arrays.
And the exact number they use is not too,

229
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,460
critical.
Okay.

230
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,469
Anywhere between ten and twenty will
improve the running time by maybe twenty%.

231
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,827
Also you could just not do anything for
small arrays, and then do the insertion

232
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:02,084
sorting in one pass at the end.
So, that's a first improvement.

233
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:07,047
A second improvement is to, try to
estimate the partitioning element to be

234
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:11,008
near the middle.
Rather than just arbitrarily using the

235
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,476
first element.
Which on average will be at the middle.

236
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:19,578
So one thing that we can do is sample the
items, and then take a median of the

237
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:23,621
sample.
And that's actually not worth the cost for

238
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:28,155
enlarged samples, not usually.
But for three it's worthwhile.

239
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:33,427
Slightly reduces the number of compares.
Increases the number of exchanges

240
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:39,185
paradoxically, cuz more exchanges are
required when the partition is right in

241
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:43,934
the middle.
So that'll also improve the running time

242
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:48,380
by maybe ten%.
So this is a summary of the optimized

243
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,655
Quicksort with cut off the small subfiles
in median-of-three partitioning.

244
00:18:54,655 --> 00:19:00,977
So partition usually happens pretty close
to the middle when you do that sample

245
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:07,812
median-of-three and then small subfiles
can just be left unsorted to be picked up

246
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:13,316
with insertion sort right at the end.
So this gives a feeling for the.

247
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:17,539
Number of items that have to be touched
during quick sort.

248
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,594
And kind of an explanation for how it gets
the sort done so quickly.

249
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:28,098
That's a summary of Quicksort, our best
sorting algorithm that we've seen to date.
