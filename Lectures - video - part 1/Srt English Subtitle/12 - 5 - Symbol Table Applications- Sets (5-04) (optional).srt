00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,052
Welcome back. Today we are going to look
at some symbol table applications, give

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:11,004
you some idea of how symbol tables might
be used, by client program for practical

3
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:15,588
problems. First when we look at, seems
even simpler than the regular symbol

4
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:19,898
tables, and that's about sets. So, a
mathematical set is just a collection of

5
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:25,849
distinct keys. And so, there are plenty of
applications where we want to just be able

6
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,486
to implement, this really simple API. I
want to be able to create an empty set,

7
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:35,661
we've got methods to add a key to the set,
and to check whether a given key is in the

8
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,760
set or not. To remove a key, and maybe
return the number of keys in the set, and

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,632
also have an iterator to iterate through
keys in the set. This is simpler than

10
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:50,332
symbol tables because it's got no
associated value. So, it's a very simple

11
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:55,333
API but of course, we're going to be able
to do these operations efficiently, how

12
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,646
we'd we go ahead and implement that. Well,
if you think about it for just a minute,

13
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:03,897
you see that what you need to do is just
remove all references to value from any of

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:09,037
the symbol table implementations that we'd
look at. The implementation is easy. Take

15
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:13,069
one of our symbol table implementations
and get rid of the code that refers to

16
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:20,027
values. Okay, so let's look at a couple of
applications where this set API might be

17
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:26,992
useful in client programs. One thing that
is very common is the idea of an exception

18
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:34,027
filter. So the way we'll set that up is to
think about having a list of files a list

19
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:40,134
of words in a file that are exceptional in
some way. In this case, we'll have the

20
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:46,055
word, the file list.text that has these
four words in it: was, it, the, and of. So

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,870
this two, complimentary ways to look at
this. One is so-called White Listing where

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,032
we want to take the words in that file
and, and then we have some other much

23
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:01,096
bigger file. And what we want to do is
print out all the occurrences of our

24
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:07,003
exceptional words in our given file. Those
are the ones that we care about, that we

25
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:11,462
want to get through. So in this case,
tinyTale.txt the first couple of words

26
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:16,602
from "A Tale of Two Cities." and these
words appear often, "It was the of, it was

27
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:22,906
the of." another, A complementary approach
is to think of these words as words that

28
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:28,076
we don't want to ever see. They're
blacklist, and we want to take them out of

29
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:32,934
our source file. So a blacklist client
would print out all the words in our

30
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:37,743
source file, tinyTale.txt except was, it,
be, and of. In this case, best times,

31
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:42,839
worst times, and so forth. So that's the
exception filter, and that's useful in

32
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:48,843
lots of applications such as the ones
listed here. For example, you might have a

33
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:53,984
spellchecker where you want to identify
misspelled words. So, then your key would

34
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:58,975
be a word or a string. And in your
exceptional list would be words that are

35
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:04,057
in the dictionary. And you'd want to print
out all the words that are not in the

36
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:09,308
dictionary. That's an example of a, an
exception filter. Or in a browser you

37
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:15,062
might want to mark your visited pages or
block sites and so forth. Or like the one

38
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:20,865
at the bottom credit cards. Maybe, you run
a credit card company and you want to

39
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:25,969
check for stolen cards then your keys
would be numbers. I. And in your list,

40
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:31,826
might be kind of short, which would be the
stolen cards that you know about, and

41
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:37,619
you'd want to run a, a white list filter
for those cards and print out in your long

42
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:42,478
list of transactions which ever
transactions have that stolen cards, So,

43
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:47,259
that's just a couple of examples of
exception filters. What's the

44
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:53,883
implementation of an exception filters?
Here's a simple one using the said API

45
00:03:53,883 --> 00:04:00,238
that we just articulated. So, we start by
creating an empty set of strings, and

46
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:06,049
again since we don't have associated
values, we just have the one generic for

47
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,821
strings, and then create a new input
stream from, from the first argument so

48
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:17,292
that's the name of the file that contains
the exceptional words and so this just

49
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:22,652
reads the strings while the input string
is not empty and then adds the m to the

50
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:28,611
set. So that now, we have our set of
exceptional words. And now, from standard

51
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:34,305
input we read words, as long as our set
contains the word, we print it out. And if

52
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:40,262
doesn't contain it, we don't print it out.
So that's an example of a white list

53
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:46,842
filter. And to implement black list we
just this call to contains, we just change

54
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:53,388
that to a, a not. If it's not in the
exceptional list, then we print it out. So

55
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:58,089
that's a simple example of a filter using
sets.
